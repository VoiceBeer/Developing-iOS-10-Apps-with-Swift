Today we are going to talk about a few things.
今天我们将讨论几个东西

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,588
We're gonna start though giving a demo about what I
我们将通过展示一个上节课谈论过的

7
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:27,225
talked about last time which is multiple MVCs.
关于多个 MVC 的 demo 来开始

8
00:00:27,294 --> 00:00:29,928
After that I'm gonna do some slides on the view controller
在那之后我将展示几个关于视图控制器生命周期的

9
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:32,931
lifecycle, really important mechanism for finding out
幻灯片，一个非常重要的关于 MVC 随着

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,002
what's going on with your MVC as time goes flows by.
时间的流逝都会发生些什么的机制

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,671
And if I have time left at the end, I'm gonna start
如果最后有时间的话，我将讲一些

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:41,740
talking a little bit about memory management,
关于内存管理的一点东西

13
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:44,776
which is basically managing the memory of reference types,
也就是管理引用类型（储存在堆里的东西）

14
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:45,777
things that are in the heap.
的内存的方法

15
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:46,845
How do they get managed?
它们如何被管理？

16
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:48,914
How do they know when the stay in the heap, or
它们如何知道什么时候该待在堆里，或者

17
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:50,616
leave the heap?
离开堆？

18
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:54,219
But first, we're gonna start with this demo.
但是首先，我们将从这个 demo 开始

19
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:58,690
I'm calling this demo emotions in FaceIt.
我给这个 demo 取名叫 Emotions in FaceIt

20
00:00:58,759 --> 00:00:59,758
If you remember last time,
如果你还记得的话

21
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,094
we built a nice MVC that knows how to draw a face.
之前我们创建了一个不错的知道如何绘制一张脸的 MVC

22
00:01:03,163 --> 00:01:05,130
It was a pretty generic MVC and
这个 MVC 非常典型并且

23
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,833
had a model, which is a facial expression.
还有一个模型，也就是面部表情

24
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,602
So now we're gonna build a more complicated app that has
那么现在我们要创建一个更复杂的

25
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,204
two MVCs.
拥有两个 MVC 的 app

26
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,140
One MVCs is going to let you choose an emotion.
一个 MVC 是让你选择一个心情

27
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,942
Like happy or sad.
像是开心或者伤心

28
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,678
And then the other MVC is just gonna be our generic face
然后另一个 MVC 就是我们的脸的视图

29
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:23,048
view, and it's gonna show that emotion.
用来表现那个心情

30
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,183
By doing that, we're gonna learn
我们会通过使用那个学着

31
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,250
how to use the split view controller and
如何使用分屏控制器

32
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:29,020
navigation controller, combine MVCs, to make a bigger app
导航控制器，来包含所有的 MVC，以创建更复杂的程序

33
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,857
It's a simple example because of time constraints but
由于时间的限制，这会是一个简单一点的例子，但是

34
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,693
you should get the idea.
你应该要懂实现的方法

35
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:38,697
So here I'm back in FaceIt, this demo we had last time.
那么现在我回到了那个 FaceIt，之前的那个 demo

36
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:40,531
One thing before I start,
在我开始前有一件事

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,134
I wanted to show you something you're going to need for
我想展示给你们一些家庭作业中会需要的东西

38
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:45,169
your homework, which is how to rename a ViewController.
也就是如何重命名一个 ViewController

39
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:46,338
I have this ViewController here.
我这里有个 ViewController

40
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:48,674
This is the ViewController that shows the face.
这就是用来展现那个脸的 ViewController

41
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:51,443
Remember, here's the faceView var and here's it's model.
记住了，这个是变量 faceView 然后这是 ViewController 的模型

42
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,880
So I don't like this name ViewController.
所以我不喜欢这个名字 ViewController

43
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,050
It's really quite too generic.
这太普通了

44
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,684
It's almost like it's super class,
几乎都跟它的父类一样了

45
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,486
which is UIViewController.
也就是 UIViewController

46
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:04,155
Really this wants to be some specifically named
这应该是一个特殊名字的 ViewController

47
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:07,025
view controller, and in this case it shows a face so
在这一个情况下它展示了一个脸

48
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:10,429
this probably best called it faceviewcontroller.
所以大概最好的名字就是 FaceViewController 了

49
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:13,231
So I wanna just type face right here, and
那么我就在这里输入 Face 然后

50
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,199
hope that's enough.
希望这样就足够了

51
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,769
But of course as I mentioned in like lecture number one
但是当然了就像我在第一节课中提到过的

52
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,705
that's not enough.
这还不够

53
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,740
You can't just rename right there.
你不能仅仅就在那里重命名

54
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,310
You actually have to rename a couple of other things.
事实上你还需要重命名一些别的东西

55
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,412
One, the file that it's in, you see the file,
第一个，它所在的文件，看这个文件

56
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,747
is still called viewcontroller.swift.
仍然叫做 ViewController.swift

57
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:34,719
We almost always want to have our name of
我们通常希望文件的名字跟

58
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,689
our file be the same as the primary class that's in there.
里面的主类的名字一样

59
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:40,091
Now, it's not required in swift, the name of the file
但是在 Swift 中没有要求，文件名字可以

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,694
could be completely different than any class in there.
跟内部的任何一个类名完全不一样

61
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,113
But generally,
但是通常情况下

62
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,464
to kinda help people find the code that they're looking for,
为了帮助人们找到他们需要的代码

63
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,234
we wanna have the name of the file pretty much match
我们希望给文件取名为

64
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:50,235
the name of the main class.
主类的名字

65
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,404
It could be multiple classes in a Swift file,
在一个小小的文件中可以有很多类

66
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,372
that's perfectly allowed as well, but
这当然可以，但是

67
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:55,974
if the main one.
只需要主类名字就可以

68
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,043
You might think, well that's enough, but
你可能会想，这就够了吧，但是

69
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,244
there's one more very,
在 storyboard 中还有一个非常

70
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,947
very important piece of this which is in the story board.
非常重要的一个东西

71
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,350
We haven't really talked too much about this- well
我们还没谈过它很多

72
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,186
actually, we did see it, with the Face View.
不过事实上我们看到过它，就在 faceView 里

73
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:10,122
We did this with Face View, but
在 faceView 里我们实现过它，但是
74
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,591
we need to inspect this controller, and I'm
我们需要检查这个控制器

75
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,094
gonna click on the controller by clicking this orange thing
我将通过点击这个上面橘色的东西来选择这一整个控制器

76
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:20,097
up here, that represents the controller for this whole MVC.
也就是整一个 MVC 的控制器

77
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:23,001
And I'm gonna go over to this same inspector we went on when we
然后我来到这个跟之前把

78
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,104
changed the face view from being a generic UI view to
faceView 从普通的 UIView 变换到

79
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,340
being a specific face view.
一个特殊的 FaceView 一样的检查器中

80
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,642
'm gonna do the exact same thing here.
我这里会做一模一样的事

81
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,378
So 'm picking this whole view controller and
那么我全选了这个控制器然后

82
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:36,147
'm going to the identity inspector up here and
来到这上面的这个 Identity Inspector，接下来

83
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,150
'm gonna change the class from ViewController,
把这个 class 从 ViewController

84
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,021
that's what it was the generic name to Face view controller.
也就是通用名字到 FaceViewController

85
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:45,057
So if you forget to do this piece,
所以如果你忘记做这个的话

86
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,292
than none of your outlets are gonna be hooked up.
那么你的所有出口（@IBOutlet）都不会被连接

87
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,360
And iOS is gonna be very confused because you're
然后 iOS 就会很疑惑因为

88
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,097
gonna be asking it to couple outlets to a different class.
你要求它把这些出口连接到另一个不同的类

89
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,033
SomeClasses doesn't exist anymore cuz I renamed it away.
由于我重命名了，有些类也就不存在了

90
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,603
You'll need to do that for your homework.
你们的家庭作业里将用到

91
00:03:58,672 --> 00:04:01,572
You'll have to change your current calculator
你要把你们目前的计算器

92
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:03,541
MVC from being called View Controller
MVC 从 ViewController 改变到

93
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,710
to being called something like Calculator View Controller and
叫做 CalculatorViewController

94
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,446
that's because you're gonna have this new MVC- the graph
这是因为你将有这个新的 MVC 也就是图像视图控制器

95
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:12,651
view controller- and you wanna make clear which one is which.
并且你想明确哪一个是哪一个

96
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,087
Now I'm not gonna touch my Face View Controller or
从现在开始，这个 demo 中，我一点都不会去碰 FaceViewController

97
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,557
MVC at all in this demo from here on.
或者 MVC

98
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,861
I'm gonna build this multi-MVC app, and
我会创建这个多个 MVC 的 app，并且

99
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,630
I'm gonna use the face view controller that I just
我将使用之前完成的 FaceViewController

100
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,199
finished building last time as a reusable component.
把它作为可重用的组件

101
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,901
Just like your graph view
就像你们家庭作业中

102
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,505
controller is gonna be a reusable MVC in your homework.
你们的图形视图控制器会是一个可重用的 MVC 一样

103
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,475
I said that I wanted to have two MVCs.
我说过了我想要两个 MVC

104
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,512
One is just a list of some emotions.
一个是一系列的心情

105
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,948
And then I'm going to use this MVC to show that emotion.
然后我将用这个 MVC 来展现那些心情

106
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:46,751
So let's just dive right into this and
那么就让我们深入它并且

107
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,254
put another MVC into our storyboard.
把另一个 MVC 放进我们的 storyboard 中吧

108
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:53,524
We have this one MVC, we get another one, in exactly
我们现在有了这个 MVC，然后我们通过

109
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:58,496
the same way that we get a new button or something like that,
跟新添加一个按钮或者之类的一样来得到另一个 MVC

110
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:02,367
which is to go down here to the utilities window
也就是在这下面的辅助工具窗口

111
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,036
at the bottom here and just drag out a view controller.
拖出一个视图控制器

112
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,004
You just pull it out and
只要把它拉出来，然后

113
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:09,007
drag it right into your storyboard like that.
像这样拖放到你的 storyboard 就可以了

114
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:11,443
Now this MVC right here,
那么这里的这个 MVC

115
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:14,111
what's gonna be its class of it's controller?
它的控制器会是哪个类呢？

116
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,814
It's just going to be (if we select it by clicking on
如果我们点击这个橘色的东西的话

117
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,750
the orange thing), UI view controller.
就能看到，是一个 UIViewController

118
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,951
In other words not a sub class.
也就是不是一个子类

119
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,120
So we're gonna need to create a custom sub class for
那么我们就需要为这个视图控制器创建一个

120
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:24,288
this view controller just like we have for
自定义的子类

121
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,990
our face view controller.
就像我们的 FaceViewController 一样

122
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,693
We'll do that in a second.
我们马上就会这么做

123
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:29,594
Before we do that though,
但在这之前

124
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,095
I wanna talk about this little arrow.
我想谈一谈这个小箭头

125
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,864
You see this arrow right here?
你们看到这里的这个小箭头了吗

126
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:36,434
This is the arrow that tells iOS when this app launches,
这是一个告诉 iOS 当 app 启动时

127
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:40,104
use this MVC as the first thing that appears.
用这个 MVC 作为第一个显示的东西的箭头

128
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,875
It's like the "entry" into the storyboard.
就像是进入 storyboard 的入口

129
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:45,610
And so if I want it to be the other one,
那么如果我想让它换一个的话

130
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,345
I can just pick it up with the mouse.
我可以用鼠标选择它

131
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:48,679
And drop it on that one.
然后把它放到另一个 MVC 上

132
00:05:48,748 --> 00:05:51,282
And now this one is my entry MVC.
那么现在这个就是我的初始 MVC 了

133
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,419
I also want you to notice that we have a warning here.
我还想让你们注意到这里有一个警告

134
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:55,987
You see this yellow warning?
你看到这个黄色的警告了吗

135
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:56,888
I'm gonna click on that,
我将点击它

136
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,624
and we'll see here it says face view controller is
然后我们就将看到它说 FaceViewController 是

137
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:03,127
unreachable, because it has no entry points.
不可达的，因为它没有入口

138
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,930
It's saying this view controller right here with
意思是这个有一张脸的视图控制器

139
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:08,366
the face, you're never gonna see that in your app.
你在 app 中将永远看不到它

140
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:11,235
Which is true, because my app is gonna come in here to this
这是对的，因为我的 app 会进入这个

141
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:14,405
blank one and I can't get to the FaceView from there.
空白的 MVC，并且我不能进入那个 FaceView

142
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,075
Now of course we're going to add SplitView controller,
当然现在我们要添加分屏控制器

143
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:19,243
and navigation controllers, and we're eventually gonna be
和导航控制器，然后终究

144
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,012
able to get there, but I just want you to understand what
能到达那里，但是我只是想让你们能苟理解

145
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,114
this unsupported configuration means.
这个不支持的标记意味着什么

146
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:24,749
It just means that you can't get there.
这意思就是你到达不了那里

147
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,951
If I move this back, this arrow off of this and
如果我把它移回去，把这个箭头移回到这里

148
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,287
back over to here, now this one, you see,
那么这个，看

149
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,555
view controller is unreachable.
这个 ViewController 就不可达了

150
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:32,758
Which makes perfect sense.
就是这个道理

151
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,028
If I run this app by the way, let's go ahead and run, you're
如果我运行这个 app 的话，你就将看到

152
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,697
gonna see that my app's gonna come up completely blank.
这个 app 会出现完全的一片空白

153
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:42,667
That face will not be there because that MVC is
这个脸表情不会在那里，因为那个 MVC

154
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:43,801
really not even being used.
甚至都没被使用到

155
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,604
It's in the storyboard right now, but
它存在于 storyboard，但是

156
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,339
since it's not accessible we can't navigate to it.
由于它不可达，我们不能导航到它

157
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,175
We can't segue to it (to use the terminology you
我们不能 segue 到它

158
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,610
learned last time).
segue，上节课讲的转场的专业术语

159
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,979
We get this completely blank UI.
我们只会得到这个完全空白的 UI 界面

160
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:01,653
If we want to have things like outlets and actions,
如果我们想在这个控制器上加些出口和方法（@IBAction）

161
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:04,956
or anything like that, with this View Controller, it needs
或者其他诸如此类的话，它就需要

162
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,625
to have a custom subclass of UI view controller,
有一个继承 UIViewController 的自定义子类

163
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:08,760
it can't just be generic.
它不能是普通型的

164
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:09,594
So we're gonna create that.
那么我们将创建那个

165
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:12,230
We're gonna go to File, New File, remember that's always
选择 File，然后 New，记住每次要创建一个新的 UIView 的子类的时候

166
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,866
where we go when we create a new UI View Subclass,
一个新的 UIViewController，任意的像是 Calculator Brain那样的

167
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,102
a new UI View Controller, any Calculator brain.
我们都是这么操作的

168
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,370
We did all those from new file.
我们都是从 New File 开始的

169
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,972
So I'm gonna click new file.
所以我要点 New File 了

170
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:26,210
This is gonna be a sub class of an iOS class, UIViewController.
这将是 iOS 系统类，UIViewController 的子类

171
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,980
I'm gonna pick this one here, cocoa touch class.
我这里要选这个，Cocoa Touch Class

172
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,915
We use swift file over here when it was just
当时我们用这里的 Swift 文件来创建

173
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,285
calculator brain, not a sub class of anything.
当时那个 CalculatorBrain，不是任何的子类，就只是 Swift 文件

174
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:35,753
But here, we're gonna do cocoa touch class.
但是这里，我们只需要 Cocoa Touch Class

175
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,589
And it says subclass of what?
然后它说这是谁的子类呢？

176
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,658
Okay, it's even defaulted here to UIVewController.
默认的是 UIViewController 的子类

177
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:41,359
Remember earlier we picked UIView.
记得先前我们选择 UIView 时

178
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:43,494
We're gonna leave this UIViewController and I'm gonna
放着这个 UIViewController 然后

179
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,498
call this view controller my EmotionsViewController.
我要给这个 ViewController 取名叫做 EmotionsViewController

180
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,802
So this gonna show the emotions like happy,
所以这个就是用来显示心情的，例如开心

181
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,402
sad, whatever, and
伤心，之类的

182
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,604
then I'm gonna click on it to go show the face.
然后我只要点击后就能展现对应的脸的图像

183
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,473
So I just do that.
接着点击 Next

184
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:56,908
Go over here, it says where do you wanna put it.
来到了这里，Xcode 询问你想要把这个文件放在哪里

185
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,676
Again, I do not wanna put it here.
再一次的，我不想把它放在这里

186
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,145
You see where it says Group FaceIt, and
你们看这个叫做 FaceIt 的包，然后

187
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,612
it has that blue icon.
它有一个蓝色的图标

188
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,548
We wanna put it down in here.
我们要把它放在这下面的文件夹里

189
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,549
So if you put it here,
如果你放在这里的话

190
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:06,584
it's gonna be at the very top level.
文件就会在最顶级

191
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:10,054
Down here, it's with all your other classes space
放在下面一个文件夹里的话，它就会和你别的一些类在一起

192
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,856
faceview.swift, etc.
FaceView.swift 之类的

193
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,391
So make sure you remember to do that.
所以要保证你们记得做这个

194
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,094
So here I popped it in there.
那么现在我把它放在了那里

195
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,329
There's my view controller selected in the navigator.
在导航器中选定的是我的视图控制器

196
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:20,198
Let's make the navigator a little bit wider, so

200
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:28,973
These right here are part of the ViewController life cycle,

It's called prepare for segue.
它叫做 prepare(for segue:)

208
00:08:49,428 --> 00:08:53,465
This is the method that's gonna be used when we segue or

209
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,468
transition from this MVC to another one.

211
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,805
here's why we do it, prepare for segue.
这就是我们为什么需要这个 prepare(for segue:) 了

212
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:03,040
We'll be coming back and implementing prepare for
我们马上会回到这里并且

213
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,944
segue, in just a minute.
实现这个 prepare(for segue:)，但是要等下

214
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,480
Now that we have this new class, EmotionsViewController,

215
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,682
we have to do the exact same thing we just did.

221
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,533
not a generic UIView controller.
不是一个普通的 UIViewController

222
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:29,801
So now that we've hooked that up,
那么现在我们已经连接好了

223
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,869
we can start building our UI here.
可以开始创建我们的 UI 界面了

224
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:32,937
What is our UI here?

235
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,798
happy and I don't know if this is an emotion but

237
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:06,337
Those are gonna be our three things we're gonna show
那就是三个我们将用我们的 FaceView

238
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,941
with our face.
来展现的东西了

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,900
So I'm gonna select them all and stack them up in a stack
然后我全选它们，然后用一个 Stack View 来

239
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,910
view, let's put a little space in between them there.
把它们堆起来，让我们给它们之间腾点空间

240
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,079
We'll fill equally even though they're all buttons, so
即使它们都是按钮，仍然选择 Fill Equally 那么

241
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:18,750
they're all gonna be filled equally anyway.
它们无论何种情况都会被平均地填充

242
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,918
So we've got this nice stack view right here.
那么现在我们得到了一个不错的 Stack View 了

243
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:24,522
Now, one thing about this stack view is, if I put it
现在，有一个关于这个 Stack View 的问题是，如果我把它

244
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:28,560
here and I go down to look at my various orientations and
放在这里然后看我的多设备选项里

245
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,796
devices, if I go landscape here, "Ugh!".
如果选择这里的横屏模式的话，噢天呐

246
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,298
It gets cut off, right?
它被截断了，对不？

247
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:37,001
So I really want these, this stack to stay in the middle.
所以我很需要这个堆保持在屏幕中间

248
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,303
I don't wanna do the same thing I did with
我不想做之前在 Calculator demo 中把

249
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,171
the calculator where I'm sticking it to the edges.
它们连接到边线上那样的事

250
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,539
I just want it to stay in the middle cuz I don't want
我只是想让它待在中间因为我不想

251
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:42,974
the buttons to be kinda really spread out.
让这些按钮拉伸之类的

252
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,743
I want them to stay kind of collected but
我想让它们保持不变但是

253
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,011
I want them in the middle.
想让它们在中间

254
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,146
I can still do that with the autolayout,
我仍然可以用自动布局来完成

255
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,249
the same way we did in the last demo.
也就是上一个 demo 中一样的方法

256
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,585
I'm just gonna pick up the thing and
我只要选定它然后

257
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,487
use the blue lines to indicate what I want.
用蓝线来指示我想要的

258
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:58,023
Which is I want this in the center.
也就是把它放在正中间

259
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:00,057
I'm holding this, so
我拿着它

260
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,759
that the blue lines come on in the center.
这些蓝线标识了中间

261
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:06,731
And when I let go, iOS interface builder here knows "
然后当我放开它，Interface Builder 就知道了

262
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,832
he wants that in the center".
“噢，他想让那个处于中心位置”

263
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,102
So that when I go down here to this little guy again and
那么当我再次来到下面这个小按钮并且

264
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,371
I say reset to suggested constraints,
选择了这个 Reset to Suggested Constraints

265
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,073
just like I did in the last lecture,
就像我上节课做的那样

266
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:18,175
it creates constraints that put it in the middle.
它创建了对应的约束然后把它放到中间

267
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,945
And we can verify that by going up to this inspector,
并且我们可以通过核对这个检查器

268
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,281
this is the size inspector.
这是尺寸检查器

269
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,548
It shows the size of the thing but
它展示了事物的尺寸但是

270
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:27,919
it also shows the constraints, the autolayout constraints.
它也能展示约束，那些自动布局的约束

271
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,255
And this is constrained to align its center horizontally
约束使它的中心

272
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,857
to the superview center and
水平居中于父视图的中心

273
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,126
it's centered vertically to the superview center.
并且竖直居中于它的父视图的中心

274
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,629
Now if we do the rotation,
那么现在如果我们旋转的话

275
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,564
we see that it stays in the center.
我们能看到它仍旧保持在中心

276
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,234
I'm giving you a little taste of autolayout,
目前我让你们尝了一点点自动布局的味道

277
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,336
I'm gonna give a whole lecture on autolayout
在几个星期里

278
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:47,439
in a couple weeks.
我会给你们上一个专门关于自动布局的课

279
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:48,973
But I'm just trying to give you a little hint
但现在我只是试着给你们一些

280
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,508
about how it works for now.
它如何工作的提示

281
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:53,845
Alright, so we have this, this is our UI,
好的，那么我们现在有了这个 UI 界面

282
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,980
that's the entire UI that we're gonna do.
这就是我们要完成的全部 UI 了

283
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,116
Now let's go ahead and run this,
那么继续，我们运行一下

284
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:01,920
run it on iPhone briefly here
简要地在 iPhone 模拟器上运行下

285
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:08,025
Just to make sure that we've actually put this in our UI.
只是为了确认我们已经把这些放到我们的 UI 界面上了

286
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,027
There it is. Sure enough if I click on it,
这就是了。能够点击

287
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,597
rotation, seems to work fine.
旋转的话，看起来也可以

288
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:14,866
We can even check to see, does this work on iPad?
我们甚至可以确认下如果在 iPad 上的话能否成功？

289
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,769
Let's try this one now right there.
试试看那个选项

290
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,008
Here it is, here's our UI.
这就是了，这个就是我们的 UI 界面

291
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:28,346
It's working fine here and we can rotate here as well and
看起来不错，然后我们也可以旋转屏幕

292
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,215
get this gigantic landscape iPad.
然后得到了这个巨大的横屏模式的 iPad

293
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,717
Is there any way to go smaller?
有什么方法能变小吗？

294
00:12:32,786 --> 00:12:35,019
What's the smallest we can go scale?
我们最小能缩放到多少？

295
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,654
25%?
25%？

296
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:39,157
There we go, that's small enough.
不错，足够小了

297
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:41,326
So we've got all this screen real estate here on an iPad.
那么我们现在在一个 iPad 上得到了这个屏幕

298
00:12:41,394 --> 00:12:44,128
It's be really great to use the split view to have these
如果用分屏的话效果会很好

299
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:47,131
words on the left and the face that matches it on the right.
也就是在左边有这些字，然后右边是对应的脸的效果

300
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,299
So that's exactly what we're gonna do,
所以这就是我们要做的事情

301
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:50,935
we're gonna go back to our storyboard right here and
我们将回到我们的 storyboard

302
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:52,503
make that happen.
然后实现它

303
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:55,273
And to do that, again, is just a matter of dragging something
为了完成这个功能，再一次的，就只是拖拉一些东西的事情

304
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,642
out, I'm gonna make my scale really small here, so
我会缩放得小一些

305
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,510
you can see this as we drag it out.
在这里拉动就可以

306
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,879
But here we're gonna drag out the split view controller
但是这里我们将拖出一个分屏控制器

307
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,916
cuz we wanna put these two MVCs in an MVC
因为我们想把这两个 MVC 放到一个 MVC 里

308
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:06,851
that has them as part of its view.
也就是把这两个 MVC 作为它自身视图的 MVC

309
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,553
So when I drag this out, you're actually
所以当我把这个拖拉出来的时候，事实上你能看到

310
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,022
gonna see I get more than just a split view,
我得到了不止一个分屏

311
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:15,760
I get some other little MVCs that come along with it here.
我还得到了一些随之而来的小的 MVC

312
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,429
And I don't really need any of these other
并且我并不是真的需要这些

313
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,830
MVCs that come along with it.
伴随而来的 MVC

314
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,232
Trying to make your life easier, but
试着让它变简单些，但是我也

315
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:23,267
I find that 99% of the time,
发现99%的概率上

316
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:26,270
you don't need these other things that come with it.
你不需要这些伴随而来的东西

317
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,372
So I'm just going here and select those and delete them.
那么我就来到这里，选择它们，然后删除它们

318
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,674
So let's get rid of this one.
让我们摆脱这一个 MVC

319
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,642
Whoops! Not the whole thing.
噢糟糕！不是所有的事物

320
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:34,946
Let's just get rid of this one,
只要摆脱这一个

321
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:39,517
sorry, there and we're gonna get rid of this one and
然后再摆脱这个和

322
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:40,718
we get rid of that one.
那一个

323
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,454
I'm just left with my split view controller and,
我只要留下我的分屏控制器然后

324
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,556
of course, my two MVCs are here.
当然了，我的两个 MVC 在这里

325
00:13:45,624 --> 00:13:48,926
Let's move this little more over to the side here,
让我们把这个往边上移一些

326
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,095
scroll down a bit.
然后往下放一点

327
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:54,799
And now I just wanna make this be the master of my split view
然后现在我要这一个 MVC 成为分屏控制器里的主视图

328
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:57,267
controller and I want this to be my detail.
然后这一个是细节视图

329
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,002
Whoops, other way around,
噢，换一下

330
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,038
this is the master, this is the detail.
这是主视图，这是细节视图

331
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,941
When the app starts, I don't want it to start here,
当运行 app 时，我不想让它从这开始

332
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,444
I want it to start here, don't forget this step.
我想让它从这里开始，不要忘记这一步

333
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,945
If you want the app to come here and
如果你想要这个 app 能运行并且

334
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,248
then show the split view controller with both things.
展示包含两个 MVC 的分屏控制器的话

335
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,318
So how do I make this the master and this the detail?
那么我如何让这个变成主视图并且让这一个变成细节视图呢

336
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:16,287
I'm just gonna hold down control and
我只要按住 control 键并且

337
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:20,024
drag from the split view controller to the master.
从分屏控制器拖拉到主视图

338
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,360
And then in here,
然后在这里

339
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,561
Only these two, master and detail.
只要选这两个，主视图和细节视图

340
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,664
So I'm gonna make that one the master,
那么我要让那个成为主视图

341
00:14:26,732 --> 00:14:29,233
it makes this little master connection there,
它就在那里创建了一个小小的主视图连接

342
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,136
that's not a segue by the way, that's a kind of like,
顺带一提，这不是 segue，这是一种

343
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,238
somewhat like an outlet connection but
像是出口连接，但是

344
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:37,675
it's a specific connection to that master var there.
是一种到那个 master 变量的特殊连接

345
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,244
This one is the detail.
这一个是细节视图

346
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,713
So I've made my master and my detail here.
那么我已经完成了主视图和细节视图了

347
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:43,581
Zoom in a little bit.
稍微放大一点

348
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:47,585
That's really all I need to do to get these both on screen.
这就是想要让这两个都出现在屏幕上需要做的事情

349
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,021
So let's go ahead and run and see what happens here.
那么继续，我们运行一下来看看如何

350
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:55,860
Alright, so here we go.
好吧，那么开始

351
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,262
Sure enough, there's the face on the right.
当然，右边有这个脸图

352
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,463
Here's this stuff on the left.
左边有这些东西

353
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,866
And if I click this, nothing happens.
并且如果我点击，不会发生什么

354
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:02,934
The face doesn't show.
对应的脸不会展现出来

355
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,702
Now why does nothing happen there?
那么为什么什么都不会发生呢？

356
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,838
Because we have to do the step of having a segue.
因为我们必须完成创建一个 segue 的步骤

357
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,307
If we want to move to a different MVC,
如果我们想转到另一个不同的 MVC

358
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,977
we have to segue to it.
我们必须 segue 到它

359
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:16,847
Each of these is gonna have to have the segue to this MVC.
这三个选项中每一个都需要连到这个 MVC 的 segue

360
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,683
And when it segues, it's gonna replace that MVC with a new
并且当它 segue 的时候，它将用一个

361
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,421
one that's properly prepared to show that motion.
显示准备好新表情的 MVC 来替换原来的 MVC

362
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,524
Let's go do our segues.
让我们开始完成我们的 segue 吧

363
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,092
Segues also of course,
当然了，segue 也是通过

364
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,628
we use our favorite gesture which is Ctrl + drag.
使用我们最喜欢的快捷键也就是 control + 拖拉

365
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,764
So if I wanna make a sad segue, I'm just gonna hold
那么如果我想要创建一个 sad segue 的话，我只要按住

366
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:38,436
down Ctrl and drag it to the MVC that I want to segue to,
control 键然后把它连到想要 segue 到的 MVC

367
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:41,038
the MVC I want to show when I press Sad.
当我按 sad 键时想要显示的 MVC

368
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:41,705
So I do that.
那么我这么做好了

369
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,241
Now, you notice that I have some choices of what
现在，你注意到有一些选项

370
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,311
kind of presentation, what kind of segue I want.
我想要什么种类的转场，什么种类的 segue

371
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,913
For example, Present As Popover would present
例如，Present As Popover 选项将会

372
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,683
the thing I'm segueing to in a little popover window on
把正在 segue 的东西展示在一个小的在最顶级的

373
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,819
top of everything else.
弹窗中

374
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:57,087
Present Modally would take over the whole screen and
Present Modally 将占满整个屏幕然后

375
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:59,023
show the new MVC.
展示这个新的 MVC

376
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,791
Then there's show and show detail.
然后就是 Show 和 Show Detail

00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,261
Show is only used when you're in a navigation controller,
Show 选项只会在一个导航控制器中用到

378
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,831
the thing where they've got the cards sliding on top,
也就是会把卡片排到顶部的那一个控制器

379
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,466
like the settings example I showed you.
就像之前展示给你们看过的那个设置

380
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:13,104
Show detail is used in a split view setting or in a hybrid
Show detail 是用于一个分屏控制器或者一个

381
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:15,973
setting, where sometimes you're in a split view, and
混合设置的，也就是有时你在分屏视图，有时

382
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,174
sometimes you're in navigation view,
你在导航视图

383
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:19,109
which is gonna be the case that we're gonna be in here.
也就是我们这里会碰到的情况

384
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:21,879
Show detail means show this in the detail side of
Show detail 意味着会把这个展示在分屏视图

385
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,147

386
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:24,882
I'm gonna show detail there.
我将在那里展示细节控制器

387
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:27,051
I've made this segue, you see it appeared right here.

388
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,185
This is a segue,
这是一个 segue

389
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,620
looks a little different from this thing,

00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,356
a little different icon right there.
图标有些不同

391
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,323

392
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,392
in fact you can even inspect it.
事实上你甚至可以检查它

393
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,194
And you must inspect it, in fact,
事实上你必须检查它

394
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,565
go to the attributes inspector and inspect it, because you're
来到 Attribute Inspector 并且检查它，因为

395
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:43,367
always gonna wanna give every segue an identifier.
通常来说你都要给每一个 segue 一个标识符

396

397
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,738
be able to reference in order to say,

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,944
So, I'm gonna call this my sad segue.
那么我要给这个 segue 取名为 sad

400
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,982
Then I'm gonna do the exact same thing here for happy.
然后我将对 Happy 做同样的事

401
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:00,350
I'm gonna just show detail on that one.
连接细节控制器

402
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,419
I'm gonna inspect that segue.
检查那个 segue

403
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,421
See, there's our sad one.
看到没，那个是我们的 sad segue

404
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,688
Notice that when you pick a segue,

it shows you what it's segueing from.
它会展示给你它从哪里 segue 来的

406
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,093
If I pick this one, it shows it seguing from the other one,
如果我选择这个，它就展示它是从另一个按钮 segue 来的

407
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,160
so we know which one it is.
那么我们就能知道这是哪一个的 segue 了

408
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,429

那么这是 happy，然后

409
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,933

00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,538
Okay, so that's it.
这就是全部了

413
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:24,242
So we've created these segues, put them in the, we'll put it
我们已经创建了这些 segue，首先把它们放在

414
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:26,577
into split view first, then we created the segues.
分屏控制器里，然后创建 segue

415
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,479
And now when you click on those buttons,
那么现在当你点击这些按钮时

416
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:32,783
it's going to segue to this detail and in fact in a split
它就会 segue 到这个细节控制器里。事实上

417
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:35,219
view it replaces the one that's there with a new one.
在分屏控制器里会用一个新的 MVC 替换掉之前的 MVC

418
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,554
Remember that segues always create a new one,
记住，segue 总是都会创建一个新的 MVC

Don't forget that, that segues always create a new one.
不要忘记

420
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:40,792
Something easy to forget.
这很容易被忽略

421
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,660
Especially in the split view, it looks like,
特别是在分屏控制器里，它看起来就像

422
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,661
" it just changed the one that was already there".
“它仅仅只是改变了原本存在于那里的 MVC”

423

But no, it actually just completely replaced that
但是不是的，事实上它是通过 segue 完完全全地替换了

424
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,134
detail segue by doing that.
原本的细节控制器 MVC

425
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,271
If we run this it it's gonna look like
如果现在我们运行的话它会看起来像是

426
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,540
it doesn't didn't even work.
没有效果

427
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,409
Even though we hooked these segues up,
即使我们已经把这些连接了起来

428
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,545
it looks like it's just not doing anything, watch.
但是它看起来仍然像是什么都没做

429
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,681
Okay, so is he sad, happy, worried, nothing is happening.
好，Sad，Happy，Worried，什么都没改变

430
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,417
Absolutely nothing is changing over here.
显而易见，这里什么都没变

431
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:09,553
Now, what's interesting is it is in fact seguing, and
现在，有趣的是事实上它已经 segue 了，并且

432
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,455
it is replacing that.
替换了 MVC

433
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,291
The only problem is, we didn't prepare that thing
唯一的问题是，我们还没为对应的操作设置

434
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,127
to show the right emotion before it showed, so
准备展示对应的心情，所以

435
00:18:17,196 --> 00:18:19,030
it is just showing the neutral emotion.
它仅仅只是展示了初始的心情

436
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,432
It's creating a new MVC, but it's just showing neutral,
它创建了一个新的 MVC，但是仅仅只是展示了初始的心情

437
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:25,303
because it has not been prepared to be onscreen.
因为它还没设置准备些什么来显示在屏幕上

438
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:28,038
We have to go back to the emotions view controller here,
我们要回到这个 EmotionsViewController 里

439
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,976
and do this prepare for segue, and prepare that destination
然后完成这个 prepare(for segue:) 函数，并且

440
00:18:32,045 --> 00:18:36,681
detail view controller to do what we want it to do.
让目标细节控制器来准备完成我们想要它做的事情

441
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,549
Let's get rid of some of the comments here,
让我们忽略一些这里的注释

442
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,217
just to make our code a little cleaner.
为了让我们的代码干净一些

443
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,551
And get rid of that, as well.
把这个也忽略

444
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,053
Actually, we can even get rid of that.
事实上，我们甚至可以忽略那个

445
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,588
Okay, so here's our prepare for
好啦，这就是我们的 prepare(for segue:)

446
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:46,690
segue with this extra argument sender,
并带一个额外的叫做 sender 的参数了

447
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,494
which I'll also talk about in a little bit.
也就是我待会儿会讲的东西

448
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,195
So what do we do when we prepare for segue?
那么我们准备 segue 时做些什么呢？

449
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:54,164
There's usually two really important piece of information
通常在准备 segue 到一个 MVC 的时候

450
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,533
we need when we're preparing to segue to an MVC.
有两个非常重要的信息

451
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:00,170
One is we need to know which segue, tha's the identifier.
一个是我们要知道是哪一个 segue，也就是需要标识符

452
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,739
The other one we need to know is what is the new MVC
另一个需要知道的是 segue 到的新的 MVC

453
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,542
that this system just created for
也就是那个由这个系统刚创建的

454
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,810
us that we're supposed to prepare.
我们需要让它做好准备的那个 MVC

455
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,380
Both of these things are found inside this
这两个东西都能在这个参数里找到

456
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,349
argument right here, this segue, this UIStoryboardSegue,
这个叫做 segue 的参数，这个属于 UIStoryboardSegue 类的

457
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,484
if we ALT click on it.
如果我按住 alt 然后点击它的话

458
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,319
Can't get it.
啊噢，没有东西

459
00:19:15,388 --> 00:19:16,654
Sorry about that, here we go, on this guy.
不好意思点错了，是这一个

460
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,956
We have the storyboard segue, and
我们有一个 UIStoryboardSegue 的类，并且

461
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,457
if you'll look in the documentation for it,
如果你在文档里查的话

462
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:22,659
you'll see that it doesn't have a lot in there.
你能看到它内部其实没有多少东西

463
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:26,163
But one important thing is the destination view controller,
但是一个重要的事是这个 var destination: UIViewController

464
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,398
and one is the identifier of the segue.
另一个是这个 var identifier: String?

465
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,300
This is also the source,
还有这一个 var source: UIViewController

466
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,135
which would be the emotions view controller.
也就是那个 EmotionsViewController

467
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,472
That's really just got the information
这些就是得到了那些

468
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:38,075
that we need to prepare this thing.
我们需要用来 prepare 的东西

469
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:41,212
Let's go and first get the destination view controller.
首先我们先得到那个目标控制器

470
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,382
I'm gonna say let destinationViewController
let destinationViewController

471
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,685
equal the segue's destination.
= segue.destination

472
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,956
So I've got that view controller.
那么我得到了那个视图控制器

473
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,625
Now that is a type UI view controller, if I alt-click on
那么它现在是一个 UIViewController 类的，如果我按住 alt 再点击

474
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,061
that, you'll see it's type UI view controller.
你能看到它是 UIViewController 类的

475
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,797
That's because segue is this generic UI stroyboard thing,
那是因为这个参数 segue 是一个普通的 UIStoryboardSegue 类

476
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:02,199
it doesn't know anything about face view controllers,
它不知道任何关于 FaceViewController 的东西

477
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,268
EmotionViewController, anything like that.
或者 EmotionsViewController，之类的

478
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,670
So, we're gonna have to actually use that casting
所以我将使用 as

479
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:08,305
mechanism with as.
来实现转换机制

480
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,375
Remember that as casting that we did with Any, in AnyObject?
还记得用 as 对 Any 或者 AnyObject 进行类型转换吗？

481
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,209
We're gonna have to do it here,
这里我们也要这么做

482
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:15,045
because this destinationViewController
因为这个 destinationViewController

483
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:17,214
better darn well be a face view controller, or
最好是一个 FaceViewController，否则

484
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,383
I don't know how to prepare it.
我就不知道该怎么 prepare 它了

485
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:21,018
That's the only thing I know how to prepare,
这是我唯一知道如何准备

486
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,487
this emotion for us, so it'd better be that.
展示我们心情图的东西，所以它最好是那个

487
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:30,760
So I'm gonna say, if I can let a FaceViewController equal
所以这里我会写，if let faceViewController =

488
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:34,932
the destinationViewController as, and
destinationViewController as?

489
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:39,870
I'm gonna do it conditionally here, a FaceViewController.
我这里会添加条件，FaceViewController

490
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,272
Then, I'm good to go.
接下来，就可以开始了

491
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,676
So now remember, this as kinda conditionally checks to see if
记住了，这个 as 是一个条件像是用来检查

492
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,912
it's possible for this to be a FaceViewController.
这个是否是一个 FaceViewController 的

493
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:52,015
And if it's not, my preparer's gonna do nothing.
并且如果不是的话，我的 prepare 就不会做任何事

494
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,784
And it's gonna let that destination view controller
然后它就会让那个目标视图控制器

495
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:54,484
appear unprepared,
展现出没有处理过的样子

496
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,953
because it doesn't know how to prepare it.
因为我不知道如何准备它

497
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:58,989
Cuz we only know how to prepare, (at least so far in
因为目前来说

498
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,025
our app), we only know how to prepare a FaceViewController.
在这个 app 上，我们只知道如何准备一个 FaceViewController

499
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,562
Okay, in fact some would say don't use, as, with,
好，事实上有些人会说这里不要使用 as 和

500
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,596
if let, here.
if-let

501
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,666
Just use as exclamation point, and make your program crash if
只要使用 as! 就可以，然后就会当你 segue

502
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:12,336
you try to segue to something you're not expecting.
到一个你不想要的东西的时候造成程序崩溃

503
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:15,172
Cuz again, you'll find it when you're debugging
因为再一次的，在上线程序之前的 debug 调试环节

504
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:16,974
before you ship your product.
你就会发现有错误

505
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,642
So I can see the argument for that.
我能理解这种观点

506
00:21:18,711 --> 00:21:22,313
But we'll make it so we'll just ignore it, if we can't
但是这里我们如果我们不能把目标 MVC

507
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:25,816
convert that destination to a face view controller.
转换为一个 FaceViewController 的话就暂时忽略它

508
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:29,353
Alright, so now let's check the identifier.
好的，现在我们来检查 identifier

509
00:21:29,422 --> 00:21:31,655
One thing about the identifier is someone might have
关于 identifier 的一点是有时候可能

510
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:33,323
forgotten to set it in the storyboard.
会忘记在 storyboard 中设置它

511
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:35,592
So I'm gonna do an if let on it.
所以我这里会用 if-let

512
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:39,696
if let identifier = segue.identifier.
if let identifier = segue.identifier

513
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,699
Cuz this segue.identifier right here,
因为这个这里的 segue.identifier

514
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,967
you can see is an optional string.
你能看到它是一个可选字符串

515
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,336
So it might be not set, in the storyboard.
所以它可能在 storyboard 中没有设置

516
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:49,540
So I'm checking to make sure that it is in fact set.
所以我在检查以核对它是否被设置

517
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,309
And now I need the expression, the facial expression,
现在我需要那个 Expression，那个 FacialExpression

518
00:21:52,378 --> 00:21:54,211
that I'm gonna set in this space for,
也就是我在这个括号里要设置的东西

519
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,114
this is where I'm gonna do the actual preparing.
这就是我会做准备工作的地方

520
00:21:57,183 --> 00:22:00,617
And I could do a little switch, or an if then, else,
我可以用 switch 或 if-else 语句

521
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:03,254
if then, else here on all the different segues: sad,
来对应不同的 segue: sad

522
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,621
happy, worried.
Happy，Worried

523
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,825
But I'm imagining that " my app might have 20 or
但是我觉得：“我的 app 可能有一天会有

524
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,259
30 emotions someday".
20 或 30 个表情”

525
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,328
As such, I wanted to do something a little more
这样的话，我想要让它有一些可扩展性

526
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,498
extensible, similar to what we did with the calculator brains
跟我们在 CalculatorBrain 中的操作很像

527
00:22:14,566 --> 00:22:17,034
operation, which is I'm going to create a private
也就是我将创建一个私有的

528
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,569
little dictionary here called Emotional Faces.
叫做 emotionalFaces 的字典

529
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:23,139
And it's going to a dictionary that has Strings as the keys,
这将是一个以 String 为键，以

530
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:27,177
and Facial Expressions Facial expressions, FacialExpression.
FacialExpression

531
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:28,846
Oops, sorry this was supposed to be colon
不好意思这里应该是冒号

532
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,750
FacialExpression as the values.
FacialExpression 为值的字典

533
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:39,656
I'm even gonna just put the values in right here.
我将把值放在这里

534
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,191
So this is just a little dictionary.
那么这就是一个小字典

535
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,695
This string is gonna be the identifier here
这里的 String 就是 identifier

536
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:50,133
that comes back, the name of our segue.
也就是 segue 的名字

537
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,436
And the FacialExpression is gonna be the facial expression
然后这个 FacialExpression 就将是我想要

538
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,306
that I want to use there.
使用的对应的面部表情

539
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,507
What's it complaining about here?
这个报错是什么？

540
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,577
Cuz I didn't have any in there.
噢是我还没放进东西

541
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:00,678
Yeah, cuz we have nothing in here.
对的，这个报错就是因为字典里还没有东西

542
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,145
So let's put some things in here.
那么让我们放些进去吧

543
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,214
Let's do sad.
创建 sad

544
00:23:04,283 --> 00:23:06,083
What's a good facial expression for sad?
悲伤的面部表情什么才好？

545
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,050
Well let's create one,
让我们来创建一个吧

546
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:12,423
a facial expression where the eyes are probably
一个有着可能是闭上眼睛

547
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:15,626
closed eyes, and the mouth is in a frown.
然后嘴巴撅起的面部表情

548
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:18,628
That sounds pretty sad all around.
听起来真的很悲伤

549
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:19,830
And then for happy,
接下来是开心

550
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:23,000
it'd probably be the facial expression with the eyes open
应该是一个眼睛睁开

551
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,504
and we'll let the mouth in a big smile, of course.
嘴上有着一个大的微笑的面部表情，当然了

552
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,705
And I think that worried,
然后我觉得那个担心的话

553
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,440
I looked at a few facial expressions.
我面部表情看得少

554
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,177
I thought, worried, the best thing that looks like that was
我觉得吧，担心的话，最好的应该是

555
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:40,984
eyes open, and the mouth kind of in a, a little smirk.
眼睛睁开，然后嘴巴的话撅起

556
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:43,521
That face, for some reason to me, looks a little worried.
那个表情，某种意义上对我来说，看起来就是有点担心

557
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:45,889
Now I've got this table,
现在我有了这个表

558
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,825
which I can add more things to over time.
之后可以再添加东西

559
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:50,827
And all I have to do is make a new segue for it, and
我要做的就是创建一个新的 segue 然后

560
00:23:50,896 --> 00:23:54,298
have the identifier match the string here.
让它的 identifier 匹配这里的字符串

561
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:57,734
Now, I might have an identifier that's not in here,
现在，我可能有一个不在这个表内的 identifier

562
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:02,139
so I'm gonna say if I can let the expression I want equal
所以我就会写 if let expression =

563
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:06,143
My emotionalFace is here, sub the identifier.
emotionalFaces[identifier]

564
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,511
So I'm looking it up there.
然后它就会去那个字典里查找

565
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,246
But it might come back nil cuz we know that if we
但是它也有可能返回 nil 因为我们知道的

566
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,181
look something up in dictionary it's not there,
如果我们在字典里找一些不存在的东西的话

567
00:24:11,249 --> 00:24:12,082
it will come back nil.
它就会返回 nil

568
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:13,150
So that time we're doing if let.
所以那样的话我们就需要使用 if-let

569
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,952
By the way, look at this I have, if let this,
顺带一提，看看这些 if-let

570
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,588
if let that, if let this.
非常多

571
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,623
And you can imagine to having four or five of these, and
你可以想象假如有四五个的话，并且

572
00:24:19,691 --> 00:24:20,924
you start getting really deep, and
你开始想要深入代码结构的话

573
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,560
the code is really kinda messy.
这些代码看起来就会很乱

574
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,028
You can actually just do these with commas.
其实你可以只用逗号来完成这些

575
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:28,398
You can just put right here, this one, and then a comma,
你可以仅仅只是把这一个放在这里，然后接下来是一个逗号

576
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,768
and then this one, and then a comma.
然后再这个，接一个逗号

577
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,737
So you can put as many of these things as you want.
这样你就可以想要几个放几个

578
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,907
And not just lets, you know, if let comma, let comma, but
不仅仅是 let，你知道的，if-let 加逗号， let 加逗号

579
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,276
also other expressions too, other things.
其他的表达式也可以

580
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:43,013
Like, it's almost like an ampersand kind of expression.
相当于是 && 表达式

581
00:24:43,082 --> 00:24:43,647
And then makes it so
然后这样的话

582
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:45,716
that I don't need all these curly braces.
我就不需要这些大括号了

583
00:24:45,785 --> 00:24:49,520
I can just use this one top level curly brace.
我只要用到这一个最顶层的大括号就行

584
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:51,622
Now I have the expression.
现在我有这个表达式了

585
00:24:51,691 --> 00:24:52,823
Here is where I'm gonna do the prepare.
然后就要在这里完成准备

586
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:57,494
I'm gonna say FaceViewController,
我将输入 faceViewController

587
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,532
prepare yourself by making your model,
准备好它自己，也就是

588
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,703
the expression equal this expression
让它的模型 faceViewController.expression = expression

589
00:25:01,772 --> 00:25:02,874
that I just looked up in that table.
也就是在表格里找到的那个 expression

590
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:12,576
So that's the actual prepare.
所以这就是真正的准备了

591
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,245
That is where I am preparing this new MVC that it
这就是我准备这个刚创建的 MVC 的地方了

592
00:25:15,313 --> 00:25:17,781
created, this brand new FaceViewController I just
这个我刚刚用 segue 创建的

593
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,882
created with the segue.
崭新的 FaceViewController

594
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,317
I'm preparing it to do what it does.
我把它准备好后来完成它的任务

595
00:25:20,386 --> 00:25:21,251
So let's see if that works.
那么我们来看看是否生效吧

596
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,953
The face should be prepared now.
那个脸表情应该已经被准备好了

597
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:26,357
When it gets created, we should see a face.
当新的 MVC 创建时，我们能看到一个脸

598
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,191
The right face.
和脸对应的表情

599
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:30,995
Okay, so here it is.
好，这就是了

600
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,162
Let's try.
我们来试试看

601
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,030
Woo-hoo, happy.
哇哦，开心

602
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,967
Well, it looks a little worried, and sad.
它看起来有点担心，然后是伤心

603
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,605
Now, let's see how happy we are, though, on an iPhone.
现在我们来看看在一台 iPhone 上有多开心

604
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,876
Because we know that on an iPhone, it's kinda small.
因为我们知道在一台 iPhone 上的话，它会有一点小

605
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:48,445
Split View, not really enough room for a Split View.
不会有足够的空间给一个分屏控制器的

606
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:50,781
So what's gonna happen with this storyboard on an iPhone?
那么这个 storyboard 在 iPhone 上会发生什么呢？

607
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:51,815
Let's find out.
我们来看看

608
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,854
Okay, well, here we go, Sad, Happy, Worried.
开始吧，Sad，Happy，Worried 三个按钮都在

609
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:59,890
Excellent, let's see Happy.
完美，那么我们点击 Happy

610
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:01,892
All right, we're happy.
不错，我们有 Happy 的脸了

611
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,460
Well, now we're not so
但是现在我们有点不开心了

612
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:06,496
happy because we can't get out of here.
因为我们离不开这个界面

613
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,131
We got this happy face but I can't get it back.
我们虽然得到了这个 Happy 的脸但我们离不开了

614
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,968
Let's try going, well, even in landscape, no Split View, so
我们试试，好吧，即使是横屏模式，也没有分屏

615
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,738
now there's no way to get back to pick any other expression.
那么现在没有任何方法能回到选择脸部表情的界面了

616
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16,706
So in the iPhone, you get to pick one expression and
所以在 iPhone 里，你只能选择一种表情然后

617
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:18,308
you're done, and that's the end of the app.
就结束了，也就是这个 app 的终点了

618
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:20,210
You have to quit the app now because, or
你现在必须退出这个 app

619
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,544
turn your phone off, I guess.
或者关掉你的手机，我猜

620
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,446
There's absolutely nothing you can do.
因为很明显你已经没有什么能做的了

621
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:23,647
You're stuck. I guess you can make
你卡在了那里，我猜你能让

622
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:24,381
the eyes blink.
眼睛眨一眨

623
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:27,185
That's about it.
大概就这样了

624
00:26:27,518 --> 00:26:29,351
So this is not a very good app on the iPhone, obviously.
所以很显然这不是一个 iPhone 上的好 app

625
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:30,620
So what are we gonna do?
那么我们要怎么做呢？

626
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:32,755
Since we have no Split View on the iPhone,
既然我们在 iPhone 上没有分屏控制器

627
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,892
(you actually can have a Split View on the iPhone by the way,
顺带一提，事实上你可以在 iPhone 上加一个分屏控制器

628
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,628
but you have to do a special stuff to kinda enable it.
但是你需要做一些特殊的事情来启用它

629
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,064
But by default the Split View doesn't work.
但是默认情况下分屏控制器是没有作用的

630
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:43,400
Well, of course, Apple understands that.
当然了，Apple 公司明白这一点

631
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,470
That Split View is not very good for iPhones.
也就是分屏控制器对 iPhone 来说不是很好

632
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,205
iPhone Plus is by the way, it does work, and
iPhone Plus 的话，是可以有效果的

633
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,739
I'm gonna show you that in a moment.
我之后演示给你们看

634
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,207
They know it's not that good.
Apple 公司知道效果不好

635
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,943
So if you go back to your storyboard here.
所以如果你回到这个 storyboard 的话

636
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,211
We're gonna go back to our storyboard,
我们回到我们的 storyboard

637
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,415
and we're gonna look at this.
然后我们看看这个

638
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,750
And we're gonna say, hmm, well, on iPhone,
然后会想，好吧，在 iPhone 上

639
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:04,688
I'd really like this UI to be navigation controller instead,
我会想要让这个 UI 界面变成导航控制器好了

640
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:05,722
not a Split View.
不用分屏控制器

641
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,558
Navigation Controller where when I click on this emotion
用导航控制器也就是当我点击选择的表情的话

642
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,593
it chose the face by sliding it on top, but
控制器就会把对应的脸滑动到顶层，但是

643
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:11,895
I'll have a back button so
我能得到一个返回按钮那么

644
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,430
I can go back, pick a different one.
我就可以返回了，然后再选择一个不同的表情

645
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,031
It'll slide it on top and I can hit back,
它就会再把对应的表情滑动到顶层并且我还可以点击返回

646
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,233
you see what I mean, so I can go back and forth.
你们懂我意思了吗，这样的话我就可以返回也可以继续了

647
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,768
And you can do that incredibly simply.
并且实现的方法非常简单

648
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,937
You just pick this view control right here, and
你只要选择这个视图控制器，然后

649
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,139
go to editor.
点击 Editor

650
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,241
Embed in Navigation Controller.
选择 Embed In 再选择 Navigation Controller

651
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,743
And it's gonna insert a Navigation Controller
然后它就会插入一个导航控制器

652
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,012
in the middle there, see that,
在它们中间，看

653
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:31,281
how I put that Navigation Controller in there.
我是如何在那里加入一个导航控制器的

654
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,351
And what's really cool is with the Navigation Controller you
导航控制器真正酷的是

655
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:37,087
actually get a little title bar, and you can go straight
你能得到一个小的标题栏，然后在

656
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,089
here in interface builder if you want and
这里的 Interface Builder 中，如果你想要的话

657
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,191
put a title in there like maybe emotions.
你可以直接在上面放一个例如叫做 Emotions 的标题

658
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,027
We could call it, it's the name of our app or
我们可以这么取名，可以叫做我们 app 的名字或者

659
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,928
that's what these are in this MVC rather, so
就这个 MVC 的内容

660
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,497
I'll put a little title in there, and that's really cool.
那么我会在那里放一个小标题，这会很酷

661
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:54,737
And so now when we run, I get my face coming up in neutral
现在当我运行的时候，就会得到面无表情的脸

662
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:58,975
mode, and if I go back, now I can pick something like happy.
并且如果我返回的话，我可以选择例如 Happy 这样的选项

663
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,844
Now one thing you might be interested in there is like,
现在那里可能有一个东西让你感兴趣

664
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:02,913
whoa, it came up in neutral mode.
哇哦，它是以面无表情出现的

665
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:06,483
Instead of coming up on this page, you kinda would expected
而不是以这个页面出现，你可能期待

666
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:08,518
it to come up on this page., wouldn't you?
是用这个页面来出现，是吗？

667
00:28:08,587 --> 00:28:10,019
And we actually made it extra credit for
事实上我们有一些额外奖励来让你们

668
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:11,188
you to go to figure out how to do it.
自己去探究如何先展示这个页面

669
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,156
And what you need to
然后你要做的是一些

670
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,258
do is something with Split View Controller.
跟分屏控制器有关的东西

671
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:17,928
It's delegate, which I'm not gonna talk about the delegates
其实是周三我会讲的代理

672
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:20,297
until Wednesday, that's why we made it extra credit.
星期三之前我不会讲，所以作为加分题

673
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,299
But you're gonna use Split View's delegate and
但是你将使用分屏视图的代理

674
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,201
read the documentation, and you can make it so
阅读文档，这样你就能实现代理

675
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,669
that it'll come up on either page.
让 app 能以任意的页面出现

676
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:28,872
Either on this detailed page or on this master page.
无论是这个细节页面或者是这个主页面

677
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,909
But you can see that this is working great, in fact we've
但是你能看到它还是有效果的，事实上

678
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,745
even got this nice little title bar up here, and we can

679
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:38,315
switch back and forth between any emotions that we want.
在我们想要的任意表情之间切换

680
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:41,184
And let's go see what happened when we did that to iPad.
然后我们来看看在 iPad 上的话会发生什么吧

681
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,187
Did we break the iPad?
iPad 上会出错吗？

682
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:52,462
Let's hope we didn't break the iPad by doing that.
希望不会出错

683
00:28:52,531 --> 00:28:53,497
Here we go.
来吧

684
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:54,431
It comes up.
它出现了

685
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,532
There's the face.
那就是脸表情

686
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,568
By the way, you can do Split Views in Portrait.
顺带一提，竖屏模式下也可以有分屏效果

687
00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,602
You just slide out.
只要滑出来

688
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:02,539
You see, it slides out like a little shelf like that.
看到没，它就像个小柜子一样滑出来

689
00:29:02,607 --> 00:29:05,875
Or you can rotate and see them side by side.
或者你也可以旋转后看他们紧贴在一起

690
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:08,044
And it's still working.
并且仍然有效果

691
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,747
So the iPad is working just fine.
所以在 iPad 上工作很顺畅

692
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:11,715
Well, unfortunately,
啊倒霉

693
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,551
there's no zoom level that's a better zoom level.
这个尺寸不好，这个尺寸好一些了

694
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,887
But the iPad has a title here.
但是 iPad 的这里有一个标题

695
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,689
But it'd be really cool if there was
如果这里也有一个标题的话

696
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,958
a title over here, too.
就会很棒

697
00:29:21,026 --> 00:29:22,359
Like maybe this would say, sad and
例如这里会显示 Sad 然后

698
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:24,194
if I hit happy it would say, happy over here.
如果我点击 Happy 的话就会显示 Happy 在这里

699
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,228
Wouldn't that be cool?
不是很酷吗？

700
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,497
To have a title on both sides of that, that's
为了在两边都有标题

701
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:29,966
often in a Split View that we want, because you want kind of
通常在分屏情况下我们都想要这样，因为

702
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,903
the balance between the two to have tittle on both sides.
两边都有标题均衡一些

703
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:37,374
So no problem, let's just go back to our storyboard here,
那么没问题，让我们回到我们的 storyboard

704
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,043
and select this View Controller and
然后选择这个视图控制器并且

705
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,446
embed it in a Navigation Controller.
把它嵌入一个导航控制器

706
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,983
And in fact, if we go here and look at an iPad.
事实上，如果我们点击这里然后选择 iPad

707
00:29:47,052 --> 00:29:49,953
What it's gonna look like on iPad, especially in landscape?
在 iPad 上看起来会怎么样，尤其是横屏模式？

708
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:50,754
We'll see that,
我们能看到

709
00:29:50,823 --> 00:29:54,090
ooh, this is looking what like exactly what we want.
噢，看起来跟我们想要的一模一样

710
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,525
Look. See,
看

711
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:57,092
when it's in detail, its got a title bar, a title bar here,
在细节视图里，它有一个标题栏，这里

712
00:29:57,261 --> 00:29:58,061
title bars there.
那里也有

713
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,596
It's fantastic, this is gonna be great.
很完美，肯定会成功

714
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:05,602
Let's do it.
我们试试

715
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:08,338
All right, look at that, title bar on the top.
看那里，顶部有标题栏

716
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:13,777
And, uh-oh, we broke it.
然后，啊哦，app 失效了

717
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,545
What happened there?
那里发生了什么？

718
00:30:15,613 --> 00:30:17,447
Why did we break that?
我们为什么让它出问题了

719
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,816
Well, this has to do with the preparation piece.
这些跟准备那部分有关

720
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,951
And I talked about this in the lecture last time.
并且我上一次课中讲到过

721
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,553
Because what prepare is doing is,
因为我们的准备工作做的是

722
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:27,290
it's creating a new MVC here, and then we're preparing it.
它在这里创建了一个新的 MVC，然后再准备它

723
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,494
The problem is that now when it creates a new MVC here,
现在的问题是当它创建一个新的 MVC 的时候

724
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,494
what is the MVC?
那个 MVC 是什么类型的？

725
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,695
What kind of MVC is it?
什么种类的？

726
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,364
Anyone want to hazard a guess?
有没有人想试着猜一猜？

727
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,732
Cuz it's not a face view controller
因为它不是一个 FaceViewController

728
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:36,733
anymore, what is it?
有人想回答吗？它是什么？

729
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,837
Yeah, it's a UI navigation controller.
对的，它是一个 UINavigationController

730
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,305
That's the new MVC we're creating,
这就是我们正在创建的新的 MVC

731
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:43,806
it has a faceView in it, but
它里面有一个 FaceViewController 但是

732
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,942
it's still a UI navigation controller.
它本身仍然是一个 UINavigationController

733
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,578
So our code that we have back here.
所以回到这里我们的这些代码

734
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:49,980
That's doing this prepare.
这个 prepare 方法

735
00:30:50,048 --> 00:30:52,916
It says, if I can let the faceView
这里写着，如果能把 faceViewController 赋值为

736
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,552
equal the destination as a FaceViewController.
转换成 FaceViewController 类型的 destinationViewController

737
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:57,354
Well, I can't do that because it's not.
所以，这个不会执行，因为它不是

738
00:30:57,423 --> 00:30:59,656
It's a UI navigation controller instead.
它是一个 UINavigationController

739
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:01,624
And I'll show you that in debugging here.
我调试给你们看

740
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,528
Let's go ahead and set a break point right here, and
让我们在这里设置一个断点，然后

741
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:07,431
go back over here and pick one, like happy.
回到这里并选择一个，例如 Happy

742
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,498
Here it breaks.
然后这里程序就暂停了

743
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,833
And if we look at this DestinationViewController,
如果我们看这个 destinationViewController 的话

744
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,270
those of you who came to the debugging Friday section.
那些周五来调试课的同学

745
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,272
We didn't really go over this cool feature, but
我们没讲到这个很棒的特点，但是

746
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,706
if you just mouse over a variable.
如果你把鼠标放到这个变量上的话

747
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:17,540
You see how I just,
你看到我如何做的吗

748
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:20,043
I'm holding my mouse over DestinationViewController?
我把鼠标放在 destinationViewController 变量上，看到吗？

749
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,378
You see it's showing that there?
你看到它展示的东西了吗？

750
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:23,479
There's two really cool buttons in there.
那里有两个很棒的按钮

751
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,382
You see this one looks like an eye?
你们看到这个像是眼睛的按钮了吗？

752
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:28,385
And this one looks like the letter i for info.
还有这个像是获得更多信息时候用的 i 的按钮

753
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:31,287
If you click the one that looks like a eye, it'll actually
如果你点击这个像是眼睛的按钮的话，事实上

754
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:34,191
show you that View Controller right there in the debugger.
它会在调试器中展现给你那个 destinationViewController

755
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,893
Which is kinda cool.
很酷

756
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:39,062
And if you go over here and click the other little i,
如果你点击另一个小 i 按钮的话

757
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:42,265
it'll show you the class that it is.
它就会展示它是什么类

758
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:45,434
In this case, it's a UI navigation controller.
在现在这种情况下，它是一个 UINavigationController

759
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,103
And this works for all kinds of types,
这种方法适用于所有类型

760
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:48,871
colors, even a map location.
颜色，甚至是表的位置

761
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,140
It'll show you a map with the location on there.
它会展示带地址的表

762
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,910
So this little mouseover debugging thing is
所以这个小小的鼠标移动调试

763
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:54,911
really cool.
很酷

764
00:31:55,178 --> 00:31:56,094
But anyway, we see that DestinationViewController
但是无论如何，我们看到那个 destinationViewController

765
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:58,114
right there is a UI navigation controller.
是一个 UINavigationController

766
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,349
We know that's no good.
我们知道这不好

767
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,950
So what are we gonna do about this?
那么这里我们该怎么办呢？

768
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,352
Well, I'm gonna check for this case, okay?
我要为这种情况检查一下，对吗？

769
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:07,390
I'm gonna say, if I can let navigationController equal
我这里写 if let navigationController = destinationViewController

770
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:11,995
the destinationViewController as a UINavigationController,
as? UINavigationController

771
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:13,163
in other words,
也就是说

772
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:17,200
if that destination is a UI Navigation Controller, then
如果目标 MVC 是一个 UINavigationController 的话，那么

773
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:21,137
I'm gonna grab the visible ViewController out of it and
我将把它的可见的视图控制器抓取出来然后

774
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:24,607
use that as the FaceViewController hopefully.
把它作为 FaceViewController

775
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,911
So, I'm gonna say in this case I want
那么如果是这一种 if 的情况的话

776
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,347
the destinationViewController, which is this thing up here,
我想要这个 destinationViewController，也就是这里的这个常量

777
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,149
which now it needs to be a var and so
现在需要它成为一个变量因为

778
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:34,951
I'm gonna change its value here.
在这里我要改变它的值

779
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,053
I'm gonna let that equal,
然后 destinationViewController 赋值为

780
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,591
the navigationController's visibleViewController.
navigationController 的可见视图控制器

781
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,359
Okay, now this is great,
好的，现在这样就可以了

782
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:46,062
visibleViewController is a really nice method and
.visibleViewController 是一个很好的方法（属性）

783
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,631
navigation control, it shows you whichever
和导航控制，它能展示给你

784
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,234
card stack is currently visible, exactly what I want.
究竟哪个视图是可见的，也就是我需要的那个

785
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,703
The only problem with it, however, is it returns
现在唯一的问题是它会返回一个

786
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:56,439
an optional, because nothing might be visible in
可选值，因为在导航控制器中

787
00:32:56,507 --> 00:32:58,074
the navigationController right now.
当前可能没有东西是可见的

788
00:32:58,143 --> 00:32:59,876
Okay, you might have never put anything
也就是说可能没有放任何东西

789
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:01,645
in the navigationController.
在导航控制器里

790
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,547
So since that is an optional, I'm gonna have to give it
那么既然它是一个可选值，我将必须给它

791
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:08,551
some default value, and the default value,
一个默认值

792
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,655
I'm just gonna say, just use the destinationViewController
就直接使用 destinationViewController 吧

793
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,056
as is if I can't get the visible ViewController or
用作如果我得不到可见的视图控制器或者

794
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:14,925
the navigationController.
导航控制器的时候的默认值

795
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,862
So it's kinda a default to use what it already was.
所以默认情况下就是它自身

796
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:20,663
Basically, don't change it.
不会改变它自己

797
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:24,234
So this little if is nice, because now my code works if
所以这一个 if 语句很有用，因为现在我的代码

798
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:27,170
it's in a navigationController or even if it's not.
在处于导航控制器中或者不是都能正常工作

799
00:33:27,239 --> 00:33:29,438
Because if it's not in a navigationController,
因为如果它不在导航控制器中的话

800
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,574
this is gonna do nothing.
这个 if 语句就什么都不会做

801
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,540
That's going to fail.
这个 if 判断会失败

802
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,476
Alright, this as is not going to work.
这个 as 就不会生效

803
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:35,078
And we'll go straight down to checking
然后代码就会跳过然后执行下面的 if

804
00:33:35,147 --> 00:33:36,079
if it's a FaceViewControllor.
来判断它是不是一个 FaceViewController

805
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:40,817
So if I later came along back to my storyboard here and
那么如果回到 storyboard 并且

806
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:41,986
I decided,
决定

806
00:33:42,385 --> 00:33:43,885
eh, you know what, I don't really want the title on here.
事实上我不想要那个标题栏了

808
00:33:43,956 --> 00:33:46,055
And I took this navigationController out
然后我拿走了这个导航控制器

809
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,891
of the picture, my code would still work, cuz my code works
我的代码也可以工作，因为我的代码

810
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,093
whether I'm going straight to a FaceController or
已经写成无论是连接到一个 FaceViewController 或者

811
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:55,598
through a navigationController.
一个 UINavigationController 都能工作

812
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,734
Let's see if that indeed fixed our problem.
让我们来看看它是否真的解决了我们的问题吧

813
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,305
Here we go, let's try it.
开始，我们试一下

814
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,509
Happy, yeah, worried, sad.
三个都行耶

815
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,611
Happy, we're happy that it's working.
Happy 也有，能正常运行真令人开心

816
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,947
Okay, now we have this nice title bar at the top and
好，现在顶部有一个标题栏

817
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:12,515
we said, wouldn't it be cool if we could put a title, so
我们曾经说过，如果这里放一个标题会很酷

818
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:13,382
let's do that.
那么开始做吧

819
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,184
Let's put a little title here,
让我们在这里放一个小标题

820
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:18,187
in fact the title I'm gonna put here is whichever button
事实上这里我要放的标题是调用对应 MVC 按钮的

821
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:19,856
brought this MVC up.
标题

822
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,224
So if the sad button brought it up,
所以如果 Sad 按钮调用了对应的 MVC

823
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,259
I'm gonna get its current title and put it up here,
我就会得到它现在的标题然后把它放在这里

824
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,094
kinda like we did in the calculator.
像是 Calculator demo 中做的那样

825
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:29,733
Look back to the sender and luckily prepare for segue,
查看 sender 里的东西，幸运的是 prepare(for segue:)

826
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,701
has the sender.
方法里有 sender 参数

827
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:34,771
This is the thing that cause the segue to happen.
这就是导致 segue 发生的东西

828
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,239
Which is going to be one of those buttons.
也就是那些按钮中的一个

829
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:41,043
So right down here, I can just get the current title of this
那么在这里，我能得到这个 sender 的标题

830
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,379
sender right here and set that to be the title.
并且把它设置到标题栏里

831
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,248
Now if you remember from the lecture about
现在如果你记得关于导航控制器那节课的话

832
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,818
navigationController, the way that you
在导航控制器中

833
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:52,055
set things that appear when it's in a navigationController
设置那些能显示的东西的方法

834
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:53,823
like the title, you can also set the buttons,
例如标题，也可以设置按钮

835
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,492
the back button title you can set,
返回按钮可以设置

836
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:58,094
or you can even put write buttons in the top.
甚至可以在顶部设置读写按钮

837
00:34:58,163 --> 00:35:00,597
You do that with this thing called NavigationItem on
那个方法就是调用 UIViewController 里的

838
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:01,297
UIViewController.
navigationItem

839
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:03,266
So I'm gonna take the faceViewController's
那么我这里要用到 faceViewController.navigationItem

840
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:06,836
navigationItem, which, by the way the navigationItem,
顺带一提，navigationItem

841
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,471
you can just kind of think of it as
你可以把它当作是

842
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,142
a bag of goodies that only UINavigationController uses.
一些只有 UINavigationCOntroller 使用的东西

843
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:13,777
And it only looks in that bag of goodies
而且仅当

844
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,079
when this ViewController, the faceViewController,
这个 faceViewController 是

845
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,548
is the visible ViewController in the NavigationController.
这个 UINavigationController 里可见的视图控制器时

846
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,683
Then it looks in this bag of goodies and you can see that
它才会看这个包里的东西

847
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,084
there's a lot of things in the bag of goodies,
你能看到，这个包里有很多东西

848
00:35:22,153 --> 00:35:25,554
like leftBarButtonItem, rightBarButtonItems, and
像是 leftBarButtonItem，rightBarButtonItems，当然还有

849
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,190
of course the title.
title

850
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:28,091
Which is what I want to set here.
也就是我现在要设置的东西

851
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:31,127
I want to set the title of the navigationController
我想要设置这个导航控制器的标题为

852
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:32,762
when this thing is visible.
当这个东西是可见的时候

853
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,496
And I'm gonna send it,
我就把它设置为

854
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:36,733
I want to send it to the sender's current title, but
我想要把它设置为 sender 的当前标题，但是

855
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,135
I can't quite do that.
这样是没用的

856
00:35:39,204 --> 00:35:40,069
Why can't I do that?
为什么呢？

857
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,138
Why is that not gonna work?
为什么这么写不会生效？

858
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:45,242
This.
这个

859
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:46,943
See any problem?
看出什么问题了吗？

860
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:50,680
Yeah, this is Any.
对的，这是一个 Any 类型的

861
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:53,650
And Any does not understand any messages.
并且 Any 类型的东西不懂任何消息

862
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,485
Because it doesn't know what it is.
因为它不知道自己是什么

863
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:59,388
So we have to take this any and turn it into a UI button.
所以我们必须把这个 Any 转换为 UIButton

864
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:06,296
And we do that by saying this, sender as the UIButton.
我们是通过这么写，sender as? UIButton

865
00:36:06,365 --> 00:36:08,164
Now we could almost send current title.
现在我们可以发送当前标题了

866
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,799
The only problem is this.
唯一的问题是

867
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,100
What is this type of,
这是什么类型的

868
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:15,372
what is the type of, if I can select it, this expression?
这个表达式，会是什么类型的结果？

869
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,239
What's its type?
它是什么类型的呢？

870
00:36:21,146 --> 00:36:22,512
No one wanna guess on this one?
没人想猜一猜吗？

871
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:25,982
No one?
没有吗？

872
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,917
It's an optional, right?
它是一个可选值，对吗？

873
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:31,821
Because "as?" returns an optional, so this is
因为 as? 返回一个可选值，所以

874
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,557
an optional, so we can't send an optional current title.
它是一个可选值，所以我们不能发送一个是可选值的当前标题

875
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,394
We need to either exclamation point it, or
我们需要要么用 ！ 来拆包，或者

876
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:40,663
a little safer, we could optional chain it.
用更安全的，可选链

877
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:43,532
Because we know that optional chaining is just going to
因为我们知道可选链能在

878
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:46,336
ignore the rest of this expression if that happened to
它不是一个 UIButton 的时候忽略整一个

879
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,236
not be a button.
表达式

880
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,638
And this as returned nil,
并且返回 nil

881
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:51,775
because this couldn't be turned into a button.
因为这个不能转换为 UIButton

882
00:36:51,843 --> 00:36:54,944
So we'll just optional chain in which case the title here
所以在这个标题可能为 nil 的情况下我们只要使用可选链就好

883
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,981
will be set to nil, because this whole thing will be nil
因为这里如果这里可选链的条件没被触发的话

884
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:00,483
if this optional chaining doesn't happen.
整一个表达式都会是 nil

885
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,284
And that's okay,
这种情况是可以的

886
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:03,920
because we look at the title of a navigation item.
因为我们看这个 navigationItem 的 tile 变量

887
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:04,988
It's an optional.
可以看到它是可选的

888
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,322
So we can send it to a nil.
所以我们可以发送给它 nil 值

889
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,859
And then this will, it will have no title up there.
然后标题栏上也就不会有标题了

890
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:11,394
I intentionally put this thing in here for
我故意把这个放在这里

891
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,229
lot of things going on here.
因为这里发生了很多事情

892
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:15,431
We have the any cast going on.
我们有 Any?

893
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,533
We have optional chaining going on here.
然后这里是它的可选链

894
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,068
We use the navigation item.
我们使用到了 navigationItem

895
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:20,570
So there is a lot in this line of code.
所以这一行代码里有很多信息

896
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,138
So make sure you kind of understand what's
确保你们能明白

897
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:23,406
all the pieces going on there.
那里都发生了些什么

898
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,177
Now we should be getting hopefully the title of
那么现在希望在右边部分的 MVC

899
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:31,647
the button appearing as the title on the right-hand side.
能有按钮的标题出现吧

900
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,782
So happy, sure enough, there's happy.
那么点击 Happy，Happy 标题出现了

901
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,051
Worried, there's worried.
Worried，标题也出现了

902
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,819
Sad, happy.
点 Sad，点 Happy

903
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,855
And of course if we rotate,
当然了如果我们旋转的话

904
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,156
we're still getting the title up there.
也能得到那些标题

905
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,191
We can slide this thing out and pick sad,
我们可以划拉出这个东西然后选择 Sad

906
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,594
and it happens back there.
然后那里就发生变化了

907
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:46,496
Slide that thing out of the way if we want.
如果需要的话还可以划回去

908
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:47,496
Rotate back.
旋转回去

909
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,165
How about iPhone 7?
那么 iPhone7 上效果如何呢？

910
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:54,971
Let's see if we've
让我们来看看

911
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,408
broken that.
我们是否毁了它

912
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:02,378
It appears with this split views detail coming up first
它一开始细节视图显示的

913
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,812
in this neutral mode.
是面无表情的脸

914
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,214
We'll go back to emotions.
回到 Emotions

915
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,216
Pick Happy.
选择 Happy

916
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,151
Sure enough, it's setting that title fine there as well.
设置标题成功

917
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,386
If we go here.
如果我们切到横屏模式

918
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:12,155
Since it's an iPhone, can't do split view,
由于它是一台 iPhone，不能分屏

919
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:16,659
it's still working fine in navigationController mode.
它仍然可以在导航控制器模式下正常工作

920
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,929
Let's go look at a 7 Plus.
我们看看 iPhone7 Plus 效果如何

921
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:22,765
There is a 7 plus which is kind of a high breed
iPhone7 Plus 是 iPhone7 跟 iPad

922
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:25,568
between iPhone 7 and an iPad.
之间的过渡

923
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,003
And in portrait mode,
在竖屏模式下

924
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,839
an iPhone 7 plus works just like an iPhone.
iPhone7 Plus 就像一台 iPhone 一样工作

925
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:30,406
So it's gonna be the
所以就是导航控制器

926
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,707
navigationController back and forth.
来回调度

927
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:35,111
But in landscape, it'll work like an iPad.
但是在横屏模式下，它就像 iPad 一样工作

928
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,614
Okay, so obviously an iPhone 7 plus in portrait mode,
所以很明显，竖屏模式下的 iPhone7 Plus

929
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:42,184
it is not big enough to do the slide-out thing like an iPad
没有足够的空间来像 iPad 的横屏模式下那样滑动东西

930
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:45,621
does in portrait mode, but in landscape mode it is, so
但是在横屏模式它就有空间了

931
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,758
let's make it so this thing fits.
现在我们来把尺寸调整对

932
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,527
That's close enough to fitting.
差不多适合了

933
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,662
I'll go small here.
我再调小一点吧

934
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,398
All right, so this is a plus.
好了，那么这就是一台 iPhone7 Plus

935
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:57,266
And you can see it comes up in portrait mode.
然后你可以看到它以竖屏模式展示

936
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,536
It's acting like it's an iPhone.
表现地就像一台 iPhone

937
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,471
See that, okay?
看到没？

938
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:02,371
It's just doing that.
就是这样

939
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,341
But look what happens if I go to landscape mode,
但是如果切到横屏模式看看会发生什么

940
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,209
I get a split view.
我得到了一个分屏视图

941
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:08,078
Tha's working fine.
也能正常工作

942
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:15,518
So see how we built in the storyboard this hybrid UI and
那么你们看到我之前在 storyboard 中如何创建这个混合 UI 界面并且

943
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:18,154
it works on all the different kinds of devices.
能在不同设备上运行的方法了吧

944
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:19,856
No matter what they control with you or
无论你用什么操作

945
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:21,290
not it'll default go back to using
默认情况下它都会使用

946
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,859
navigationController, whatever.
导航控制器

947
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,594
And the only thing we had to do in our code
唯一我们需要在代码中做的

948
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:27,029
as a concession to the cross-platform is checking for
跨平台的事情就是

949
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,864
that navigationController and only for
检查那个导航控制器还有那个

950
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,367
the thing we were segueing to.
我们 sugue 的东西

951
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,239
Back to the slides.
回到幻灯片

952
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,915
Our next topic here is the View Controller Lifecycle.
我们下一个主题是视图控制器的生命周期

953
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,351
Now, everything has a life cycle,
每一样东西都有生命周期

954
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:51,987
even we have a life cycle: we're born, we live our lives,
即使我们也有：我们出生，生活

955
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,289
things happen, and we die.
各种事情发生，然后我们死亡

956
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,224
Well, that happens to a View Controller as well.
视图控制器也是这样

957
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:58,093
It's just born, things happen to it, and then it dies,
就是出生，然后发生了些事情，接着它死亡了

958
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:58,995
it leaves the heap.
并且离开了堆

959
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:01,230
That's what happens on its death.
它死亡的时候会发生的事情

960
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,533
Why do we care about the view controller lifecycle?
为什么我们要在意视图控制器的生命周期呢？

961
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:07,637
Because we often wanna do things at various key
因为通常我们想要在它生命周期中的关键转折点

962
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:10,373
inflection points in its lifetime.
做一些事情

963
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:12,175
The start of a lifecycle is really simple.
生命周期的开始很简单

964
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,678
It gets initialized, and 99.99% of
它被初始化，并且 99.99% 的情况下

965
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,815
the time a view controller is coming out of a storyboard.
一个视图控制器会出现在 storyboard 中

966
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:23,086
Its initializer is this special initializer coming out
它的构造器就是这个 storyboard 中出现的

967
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:24,387
of a storyboard.
这个特殊的构造器

968
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:25,621
In your reading assignments,
在你们的作业中

969
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,156
I actually explained how this works.
我已经解释过它如何工作了

970
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:31,226
But we don't usually override the initializer of a view
但是我们通常不会重写一个视图控制器

971
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:31,596
controller.
的构造器

972
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:32,695
We're going to use the other ways we know to initialize
我们将使用另一个方法来初始化

973
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,198
each variables.
每一个变量

974
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,401
I'm not even gonna talk about how to make one in code.
我甚至不会讲用代码如何实现一个

975
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,236
Because we just, just don't do that.
因为我们通常，不那么做

976
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,471
You can see why, right?
你们知道为什么的，对吧？

977
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,773
Because view controller is complicated.
因为视图控制器很复杂

978
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:45,441
It's got all the UI, the buttons, and all the stuff.
它得到了所有的 UI 界面，按钮，还有别的东西

979
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:49,912
You're generally not gonna be making that in code.
一般来说都不会用代码来做到

980
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:51,648
What happens then after it's created?
那么它创建后发生了什么呢？

981
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:54,750
The next thing that happens is if it's being segued to,
下一件会发生的事情是如果它被 segue 的话

982
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:55,819
it gets prepared.
它就会被 prepare

983
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,188
Like when we prepared the FaceView Controller there by
就像我们通过设置它的模型

984
00:40:59,257 --> 00:40:59,956
setting it to model.
来准备那个 FaceViewController

985
00:41:00,025 --> 00:41:01,490
That's the next thing that happens after it's
这就是它被初始化后接下来的

986
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,426
initialized.
事情

987
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:06,329
Then the next thing that happens is its outlets get set.
接下来下一件事是它的出口（outlet）被设置

988
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,196
So, for the FaceView,
举个例子 FaceView

989
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,366
its FaceView outlet got set after it got prepared.
FaceView 的出口是在它准备好后设置的

990
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:13,670
Then, it appears and disappears on screen.
接着，这个视图控制器在屏幕上就会出现还有消失

991
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:18,541
In our example right there, the master
我们的那个例子中，主视图控制器

992
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:21,343
was constantly appearing and disappearing on screen.
就重复着在屏幕上出现和消失

993
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:23,979
Every time, on the iPhone, for example, that we hit happy or
举个例子，在 iPhone 上，每一次当我们点击 Happy 或者

994
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:25,481
sad, it would disappear.
Sad 的时候，它就消失

995
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,149
And the face one would come on.
然后那个脸图就会出现

996
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:30,252
And then, we'd hit back and it would reappear.
接着，我们点击返回，那个主视图就会再次出现

997
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,922
By the way, when that happens, the face one didn't disappear.
顺带一提，当那个发生的时候，脸图没有消失

998
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:33,723
Well, it disappeared and
好吧，视觉上它是消失了

999
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,425
it also got thrown out of the heap.
并且它也从堆中扔了出来

1000
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,526
Because we reuse the things we segue to.
因为我们重用了我们 segue 到的东西

1001
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,662
But that master, we don't segue to it.
但是那个主视图，我们没有 segue 到它

1002
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:42,632
It sits there as the master in the split view all the time.
它就作为分屏视图中的主视图一直在那

1003
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:44,533
But it's appearing and disappearing on screen.
但是它在屏幕上会出现和消失

1004
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,169
So that's a big thing that happens its lifecycle.
所以这就是在它生命周期内的一件大事

1005
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:48,237
Another thing that happens
另外一个会发生的事情

1006
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:51,407
during the life time of it is it's changing its orientation.
是屏幕发生发生了旋转

1007
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,342
We're rotating the landscape.
如果我们把设备旋转至横向

1008
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:54,210
We're on a iPad and
如果我们是在 iPad 上

1009
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:58,013
we're sliding it out as a tray in portrait mode and
纵向模式我们需要把主视图像个托盘一样滑出来

1010
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,082
then we rotate to landscape and it's sitting on the side.
然后我们又把它旋转至横向模式，它就又出现在那里了

1011
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:02,785
So it's changing its shape.
所以它改变了它自己的形状

1012
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,187
Even the face view of the iPad when we're in portrait,
就像在 iPad 上的 FaceView，当它在纵向模式时

1013
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,623
it's big, tall and big.
它又高又大

1014
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,391
But then we switch to landscape it's kind of more
但是当我们把它旋转至横向模式时，它就变的有点

1015
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,592
like a square, and a little smaller.
像个小方块，然后还有点小

1016
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,628
So it's always changing geometry.
所以它总是会改变自己的几何形状

1017
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,831
And then it could be in a low memory situation as well where
与此同时它也可能处在一种内存紧张的情况下

1018
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,899
we need to recovery some memory,
这样我们就需要回收一部分内存

1019
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:19,368
this almost never happens, but I have to mention it.
这种情况几乎从不发生，但是我也得提一下

1020
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,404
It's really maybe not even part of the view controller
它甚至可能不存在于控制器的

1021
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,273
lifecycle but it's a good place to talk about it,
生命周期中，但是这是个讨论它的好地方

1022
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:25,608
cuz it's not really that important.
因为它其实没那么重要

1023
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:31,714
Let's talk about the messages that
我们来聊聊哪些消息被发送

1024
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:34,383
are sent to invoke methods in your view controller
来调用视图控制器的方法

1025
00:42:34,452 --> 00:42:37,086
when these various things happen.
以表明这一些列的事情发生了

1026
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:40,623
So you already know about your outlets being set.
所以你已经知道你的出口变量已经被关联好了

1027
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,625
And you can watch that with your did sets,
而且你可以通过你的 didSet 来观察

1028
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:43,959
the property observer, did set.
那个属性观察器，didSet

1029
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,594
And you already know about preparing,
你也已经了解了如何准备

1030
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:46,996
I just showed you about that.
就是我刚刚展示给你的那个

1031
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,164
So after those two steps are done,
所以当这两步都做完了之后

1032
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,834
you're gonna get this message, viewDidLoad.
你就应该会获得信息 viewDidLoad

1033
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,936
Super important method.
这是个非常重要的方法

1034
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:57,106
You're only gonna ever receive it once in the lifetime
在你的控制器的整个生命周期中你只会收到一次

1035
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,007
of a viewController.
来自它的信息

1036
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:01,878
And it's really where you're gonna put
所以这个方法几乎是你

1037
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:04,780
almost all of your initialization.
完成所有初始化地方

1038
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:07,950
For example, a lot of times here's where you'll call your
举个例子，通常这里是你调用 updateUI

1039
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:11,554
update UI method, the thing that updates your UI from your
那个用模型来更新 UI 的方法的地方

1040
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:16,025
model, very often you're gonna call that in viewDidLoad.
经常你将从 viewDidLoad 中调用它

1041
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,728
Cuz now your model is set because it got prepared
因为现在你的模型应该已经被设置，准备好了

1042
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:21,330
probably, and your outlets are set because this is how it
你的出口变量也关联上了

1043
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:23,299
always happens after outlet setting.
因为 viewDidLoad 总是在那之后被调用

1044
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:25,534
Now, one thing not to do in here though.
但是还有一件并不在这里进行的事

1045
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,136
Very careful, listen carefully.
非常重要，认真听

1046
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:29,805
Do not do geometry-based things in viewDidLoad.
不要在 viewDidLoad 里设置任何和几何形状相关的东西

1047
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:31,173
Because when viewDidLoad happens,
因为当 viewDidLoad 被执行时

1048
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:34,711
you have not yet had your final geometry established.
你其实还没能完全确定你最后要呈现的几何形状

1049
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,814
You don't quite know if you're portrait, landscape,
你并不是十分确定你的设备是纵向还是横向

1050
00:43:38,883 --> 00:43:40,649
what device you're on, you don't know yet.
你将要在什么设备上运行，这些你都还不知道

1051
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:44,353
So do not do things with your bounds in viewDidLoad.
所以不要在 viewDidLoad 中做任何关于边界的设置

1052
00:43:44,421 --> 00:43:47,890
Many of you will make this mistake so perk up those ears.
你们当中的一些人会犯这个错误，所以竖起耳朵认真听

1053
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:48,924
Do not do that.
不要这么做

1054
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,759
I'm gonna show you other methods in the new controller
我会教你们其他的控制器生命周期的方法

1055
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:54,663
lifecycle for doing that but do not it in viewDidLoad.
来做关于几何形状的工作，但是不要在 viewDidLoad 里做这件事

1056
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,199
The next thing I said to you, appear and disappearing.
下一个我要说的是，“出现”和“消失”

1057
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:59,902
You're always appearing and disappearing on screen.
你总会在屏幕上进行“出现”和“消失”的动作

1058
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:02,071
When you appear, you're gonna get two messages.
当你“出现”时，你会得到两条信息

1059
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,306
The first is viewWillAppear.
第一个是 viewWillAppear

1060
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:08,410
And that's sent to you before you're actually on screen, but
它在你真正要出现在屏幕上之前发送给你

1061
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,613
just very very soon going to be,
但是在之前非常短的时间里（发送给你）

1062
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:13,315
guaranteed you're going to be on screen soon.
确保你马上就要出现在屏幕上了

1063
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,951
So, what is viewWillAppear for?
所以，这个 viewWillAppear 是干什么的呢？

1064
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,653
What are you going to do in a view will appear?
你在这个 viewWillAppear 中要做些什么呢？

1065
00:44:17,722 --> 00:44:21,023
Well one thing is if there's anything that changes in your
第一，当你不在屏幕上时

1066
00:44:21,092 --> 00:44:22,891
model when you're not on screen,
你模型里有什么东西改变了

1067
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,060
maybe your model is a network database or
你的模型可能是一个网络数据库或者

1068
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,496
something and it's changing on the screen.
是一个可能在屏幕上变化的什么东西

1069
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:30,332
Then when view appear happens you're going to usually update
当 viewWillAppear 发生时，你通常需要从你的

1070
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:31,901
your UI from your model.
模型中获取信息来更新你的 UI

1071
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,537
So maybe you wouldn't do update UI in viewDidLoad,
所以你可能不在 viewDidLoad 中更新你的 UI

1072
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,539
you might do it here.
可能你会选择在这里更新

1073
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,540
That's if it could change when it's not onscreen.
这是对不在屏幕上时的变化的处理方法

1074
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:39,475
A lot of MVCs,
有很多 MVC

1075
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:41,743
their model only changes when they're onscreen, so
它们的模型只在它们出现在屏幕上时才会改变

1076
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,312
you wouldn't have to do anything here.
这样的话你在这就什么也不需要做了

1077
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,181
But if your model can be changed out from under you
但是如果你的模型可以在你不在屏幕上时被改变的话

1078
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,316
while you're off screen, then you, when you reappear,
那你，在你重新出现的时候

1079
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,685
obviously you wanna show the current state of your model.
你显然要展现你模型的确切状态

1080
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:50,920
So that's a good one.
这是个好方法

1081
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,821
Another thing you might do in viewWillAppear
还有一件你可能会在 viewWillAppear 中做的事

1082
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,557
is start something expensive.
就是开启一些非常耗费资源功能

1083
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:58,060
Because in viewDidLoad you're not guaranteed that you're
因为在 viewDidLoad 中，你不确定你到底会不会

1084
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,628
ever gonna come on screen.
出现在屏幕上

1085
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,264
There are MVCs that occasionally get loaded up,
有一些 MVC 无意间被加载了

1086
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:04,500
but then the user clicks away somewhere else and
但是用户点了一些其他的地方，因此

1087
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:05,868
you never get shown on screen.
你的 MVC 从来就没有出现在屏幕上

1088
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:07,102
But if viewWillAppear happens,
但是如果 viewWillAppear 发生了

1089
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,404
you know you're going on screen.
你确切的知道你会出现在屏幕上

1090
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:11,073
So here you could kick off something expensive.
这时候你就可以开启一些非常耗费资源的功能了

1091
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:12,608
Especially kick off a thread that goes and
比如开启一个

1092
00:45:12,677 --> 00:45:14,309
does something expensive in the background.
非常耗费资源的后台进程

1093
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,745
Cuz we're gonna talk about multithreading next week and
我们会在下周讲多线程

1094
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:19,314
you're gonna see that anything that takes any amount of time
到时候你就会看到，对于任何花时间和经历

1095
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,584
or energy on the part of the processor or the network,
需要耗费处理器资源或者占用网络带宽的东西

1096
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,619
you're gonna want to do it in a separate thread.
这些你应该在另一个进程里完成

1097
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:26,455
So you might kick off such a thread here in viewWillAppear.
viewWillAppear 就是创建这种线程的地方

1098
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:28,323
There's also an another method,
还有另外一个方法

1099
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:31,727
viewDidAppear which gets into after you're fully on screen.
viewDidAppear 这个方法在你完全出现在屏幕上之后发送给你

1100
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:34,596
The animation to get you on screen is on screen so
把你带到屏幕上的动画效果已经出现在屏幕上了

1101
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:35,598
you're there.
你也在屏幕上

1102
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:37,899
And what would you do here?
那么在这里你能做些什么呢

1103
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:39,668
There's usually not a lot to do here.
这里通常没那么多事要做

1104
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,438
You might start an animation though.
你可能在这开始一个动画效果

1105
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:45,374
You've got some MVC that has some animation going.
你有一些有动画效果的 MVC

1106
00:45:45,443 --> 00:45:47,677
And it doesn't make any sense to start it before it
但是这些动画效果没必要在 MVC 出现之前运行

1107
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,578
So once it gets on screen then you start it going.
所以当他们出现在屏幕上时

1108
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,412
gets on screen.
再开启动画效果

1109
00:45:50,782 --> 00:45:52,214
ViewWillAppear and viewDidAppear happen so
viewWillAppear 和 viewDidAppear 发生的时间

1110
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:55,117
close together, it's probably not gonna save much to wait
十分接近，所以在 viewDidAppear 再开始播放动画效果

1111
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:56,752
until viewDidAppear to start the animation,
和在 viewWillAppear 中开始没多大差别

1112
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:58,354
but eh, a lot of people will do that,
但是为了让程序更加明晰

1113
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:01,356
just to kind of for clarity of programming.
很多人选择这样做

1114
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:01,924
And then, of course,
然后，当然啦

1115
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:04,060
you can disappear, and get the same thing there,
你也可以消失。类似的，消失时会调用

1116
00:46:04,128 --> 00:46:06,495
a viewWillDisappear and a viewDidDisappear.
viewWillDisappear 和 viewDidDisappear 方法

1117
00:46:06,564 --> 00:46:09,999
One thing you notice in all of these view controller
在这你会注意到，所有这些视图控制器

1118
00:46:10,068 --> 00:46:12,701
lifecycle is that I'm calling super.
生命周期（方法）中，我都会调用 super

1119
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,402
You see that?
你看见了吧

1120
00:46:13,471 --> 00:46:16,405
super.viewWillDisappear, and I did it for
super.viewWillDisappear，我还用了

1121
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:20,509
super.viewDidLoad, and super.viewWillAppear.
super.viewDidLoad 和 super.viewWillAppear

1122
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:23,312
All of them, all of the view controller lifecycle methods,
所有这些，所有视图控制器生命周期的方法

1123
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:25,681
always call super.
总是要调用 super

1124
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:28,083
You always wanna give your super class chance to do it.
你总是要给你的父类一个完成它工作的机会

1125
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,253
You'll see actually in the demo why you do that.
你将会在我的示范中了解为什么要这么做

1126
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:32,254
Always do that.
但记住总是要这么做

1127
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:33,589
Always do super there.
总要调用这个 super

1128
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:38,060
So in viewWillDisappear, a lot of times here you're
在 viewWillDisappear 里，很多时候你都是在

1129
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,663
undoing the things you did in viewDidAppear.
撤销你在 viewDidAppear 所做过的事情

1130
00:46:40,732 --> 00:46:42,030
Like if you had an animation going,
比如说如果你在那有个动画效果

1131
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,065
you're gonna stop it here,
那么你就要在这把它停下

1132
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,400
because you're about to disappear.
因为你就要消失了

1133
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,870
Here you might also start some cleanup.
你还可能在这进行一些清理工作

1134
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,138
Your MVC disappeared, and
你的 MVC 消失了

1135
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,641
so, if you allocated some resources or something that
如果你分配了一些已经不需要的资源或者什么别的东西

1136
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,344
you don't need, network connection open or something.
又或是开启的网络链接或者什么其他的东西

1137
00:46:55,413 --> 00:46:58,080
That only makes sense to be open while your MVC is on,
总之只有在你的 MVC 运行的时候开启才有用的

1138
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,749
then here is a good place where you can shut it down,
那么这里就是一个你关闭它的好地方

1139
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:03,052
and there is a did version of this as well.
它也有一个 did 的版本

1140
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,555
A lot of times people look at viewDidAppear and
很多时候我们将 viewDidAppear

1141
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:09,691
viewWillDisappear as matched, you know, one undoes
和 viewWillDisappear 视为一对儿，你懂的，一个撤销

1142
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,295
the other, and then the same thing with viewWillAppear and
另外一个做过的事情；viewWillAppear 

1143
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:15,498
viewDidDisappear, those are gonna undo each other.
和 viewDidDisappear 也一样，一个撤销另一个做的事

1144
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:20,736
I still haven't talked about geometry until now.
直到现在我们还没有讨论布局相关的事

1145
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:22,904
You don't want to be doing geometry in viewWillAppear.
你不会想在 viewWillAppear 中布局

1146
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:25,007
Your geometry actually probably is set
虽然在 viewWillAppear 被调用时

1147
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:27,042
in viewWillAppear, but you shouldn't count on that.
布局相关的已经不会变了，但是你不应该指望它

1148
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:29,311
You shouldn't do geometry in the view wills and
你也不应该在各种 viewWill

1149
00:47:29,379 --> 00:47:31,313
did appears and disappears either.
didAppear 或 disappear 中布局

1150
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:35,050
Geometry changes: there's methods especially for it.
布局，有专门设置它们的方法

1151
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:37,686
One thing to consider is, you almost never need to write any
有一件需要注意的事就是，你几乎不用写任何代码

1152
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:40,122
code when your geometry changes.
来完成需要的重新布局

1153
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,023
That's cuz you have auto layout.
那是因为你使用了自动布局（Auto Layout）

1154
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:43,792
I mean, look at the app I just wrote.
我的意思是，你看我刚刚写的这个 app

1155
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:47,129
I've got that sad, happy, worried block of text, and
Sad，Happy 和 Worried 那一块内容

1156
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,497
when I rotate it it stays in the middle.
即使在我旋转设备的时候，它们始终在中间

1157
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:50,632
I didn't have to write any code for that.
我不需要为此写任何代码

1158
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,568
And even more complicated UI's.
即使在更加复杂的 UI 中

1159
00:47:52,637 --> 00:47:54,336
You're usually using auto layout and
你也会经常用自动布局

1160
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:55,804
it's doing it for you.
来帮你做这些工作

1161
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,206
So most time you don't need any code.
所以大部分时间你不需要任何代码

1162
00:47:57,274 --> 00:48:00,242
But if you did feel like you needed to do some code
但是如果你觉得你还是想写一些代码的话

1163
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,411
Let's talk a little bit about how you do that.
我也可以教你一点怎么写

1164
00:48:04,082 --> 00:48:06,982
There's two methods, viewWillLayoutSubviews and
这有两个方法，viewWillLayoutSubviews

1165
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:08,550
viewDidLayoutSubviews.
和 viewDidLayoutSubviews

1166
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,019
And these are sent to you.
你的这两个方法会被调用

1167
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:13,656
In between these being sent to you, Autolayout happens.
而自动布局是在它们之间发生的

1168
00:48:15,193 --> 00:48:18,994
So if you wanna get involved in the geometry change of your
所以如果你想在自动布局发生前

1169
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,898
view, before Autolayout starts,
插手改变你的形状和/或位置的话

1170
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:23,399
you can do it in view will layout subviews.
你可以使用 viewWillLayoutSubviews 方法

1171
00:48:23,468 --> 00:48:25,534
If you wanna wait until Autolayout does what it does
如果你想等自动布局做完它的工作之后

1172
00:48:25,603 --> 00:48:26,568
and then you wanna get involved,
再插手控制的话

1173
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,037
you can do it in viewDidLayoutSubviews.
你可以用 viewDidLayoutSubviews 方法

1174
00:48:29,106 --> 00:48:31,474
So when did these get called?
所以它们在什么时候会被调用呢？

1175
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,378
When a bounds of a view changes,
在视图的边界改变时

1176
00:48:35,446 --> 00:48:38,714
all of its subviews might have to be moved around.
可能所有的子视图都会改变他们的位置

1177
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:40,582
Maybe the view is know tall and
视图可能会从又长又细

1178
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,052
thin, instead of short and wide.
变成又短又宽

1179
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,521
It's views are gonna have to be moved to be in the right
这时它的子视图必须被移动到正确的位置上去

1180
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,490
place, just like again we rotated the emotions thing and
就像我们的 Face It，当我们旋转设备时

1181
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,559
we need to move that stack view up or
我们需要把那个 UIStackView

1182
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:53,762
all over a little bit sustained in the middle.
整体向上移才能使它保持在中间

1183
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:55,197
That's primarily what's going on here,
差不多就是这样

1184
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,334
that's why this method is called viewWillLayoutSubviews.
所以这个方法叫做“视图将要布局子视图”

1185
00:48:58,402 --> 00:48:59,668
Its bounds changed and
它的边界改变了

1186
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:01,837
now all its subviews need to be laid out.
然后它的所有子视图都要重新被布局

1187
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,307
What about the things the view actually draws itself like
但是那些自己进行绘图的视图要怎么办呢？

1188
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:05,207
the face?
比如 FaceView

1189
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,842
That has nothing to do with this.
它们什么都不用在这里做

1190
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:08,743
That's a view thing.
那是视图负责的

1191
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:11,647
That face view, when the bounds change, if it's content
当 FaceView 边界改变时，如果 contentMode

1192
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:14,950
mode is redraw like we set it for the face view, it's draw
内容模式是我们设置的重绘，也就是 .redraw

1193
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:18,720
method's automatically gonna get called at the new bounds.
draw(新的边界) 就会被调用（来重新绘图）

1194
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,455
So you don't have to do anything there.
所以你不需要在这里做任何事

1195
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,224
So viewWillLayoutSubviews,
所以 viewWillLayoutSubviews

1196
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,659
is what happens, when you have subviews.
只有当你有子视图的时候才会发生

1197
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,596
This happens at the view level, so views have a method
这是在视图层面发生的；视图有方法

1198
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:30,199
for laying out their subviews, called layoutSubviews.
用 layoutSubviews 布局子视图

1199
00:49:30,268 --> 00:49:33,102
And the ViewController also gets to
然后视图控制器也能了解到

1200
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:36,905
find out when its view, and by this I mean the var
它的 view，也就是那个变量

1201
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,241
view in ViewController, you remember what that var is?
UIViewController 的 view 变量，你记得那个吧？

1202
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,410
That's that top level view.
那个是最顶层的视图

1203
00:49:41,479 --> 00:49:43,212
There's a var for that in your ViewController,
UIViewController 里有这么个变量

1204
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:46,615
it's saying that view is going to layout its subviews, and
总之控制器会知道这个 view 将布局子视图了

1205
00:49:46,684 --> 00:49:49,718
that happens when that top level view changes, usually
在最顶层的视图改变时就会被通知

1206
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,488
due to rotation, but other things can change it as well.
一般都是发生在设备旋转时，但是也有一些其他东西会触发（这种变化）

1207
00:49:55,793 --> 00:49:59,728
One thing about these methods is you should expect that they
关于这些方法，有一点需要注意，那就是你应该

1208
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:02,198
may be called all the time.
做好它们会被随时调用的准备

1209
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:04,299
Don't try to anticipate when they're going to be called.
不要尝试去预期它们什么时候会被调用

1210
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:06,735
Just, whenever they're called, you do
不管什么时候它们被调用 

1211
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:07,702
what you're supposed to do,
你就做好你该做的工作

1212
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:10,372
and they might be called repeatedly with the same
而且它们可能在相同的边界下被重复的

1213
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:11,373
bounds.
调用

1214
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:13,375
So the bounds might not actually have changed,
所以可能边界并没有被改变

1215
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,578
because this is not called view bounds changed this is
因为这个方法并不叫做“视图边界被改变”

1216
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:18,280
called viewWillLayoutSubviews and viewDidLayoutSubviews.
它叫做“视图将要布局子视图”和“视图已经布局好了子视图”

1217
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,682
And there are other things besides bounds changes that
所以也有一些除了视图边界被改变的情况

1218
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:23,152
might cause that top-level view to have to layout it's
也可能导致顶级视图不得不布局它的

1219
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,020
sub views.
子视图们

1220
00:50:24,088 --> 00:50:26,488
So expect this to be called fairly often and
所以做好它们被相当频繁调用的准备

1221
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:29,458
you should always react to it correctly.
你总是应该做出正确的反应

1222
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,026
Even if it's called repeatedly with the same
即使它们在同一边界下或其他各种情况下

1223
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:31,927
bounds or whatever.
被频繁调用

1224
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,297
Now, auto rotation,
现在我们来讲自动旋转

1225
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,466
the bounds changing by rotating the device, actually
边界会因为设备的旋转而改变，实际上

1226
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,603
has a couple of little extra pieces of interest to it.
还有两个额外的小东西我们要注意下

1227
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:44,473
The most notable is animation.
最值得注意的就是动画效果

1228
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,942
So normally when you rotate it's just going to be
所以一般情况下，当你旋转屏幕时

1229
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:50,011
ViewWillLayoutSubviews and everything's just going to,
viewWillLayoutSubviews 会发生

1230
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,949
auto layout's going to happen, everything is happening fine.
自动布局会发生，所有的事都进行的很好

1231
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:57,519
However that changes, all those changes are animated.
不管它怎么变，所有这些变化都伴随着动画效果

1232
00:50:57,588 --> 00:51:00,289
If you look closely when you rotate your device, all
如果你在旋转屏幕时仔细观察你会发现

1233
00:51:00,358 --> 00:51:03,892
the views are kind of flying across to their new location.
所有的视图都像是飞到它们的新位置一样

1234
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,394
It's really kinda cool actually.
这样看起来可以说非常酷了

1235
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:07,630
They're being animated.
它们都伴随有动画效果

1236
00:51:07,698 --> 00:51:09,698
They don't just pop appear in the new place,
它们并不是突然出现在新位置上

1237
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,100
they slide over.
它们滑过去

1238
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:13,068
Well, you can participate in that animation,
当然你也可以插手设置这些动画效果

1239
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:14,336
now we haven't talked about animation.
到现在我们还没有讨论过动画效果

1240
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,905
We will in about three weeks.
我们大概三周之内会讨论它

1241
00:51:16,974 --> 00:51:18,407
But you can participate with this method,
但是你可以用这个方法参与这个过程

1242
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,576
ViewwillTransition to size with coordinator.
用 viewwillTransition(to size:with coordinator:)

1243
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:24,246
And that coordinator has a little closure you can set on
负责协调的 coordinator 有个闭包可以设置

1244
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:27,016
it that will cause some animation you want to do
来做一些你想要的动画效果

1245
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:31,052
to happen alongside the rotations animation.
一些你想在设备旋转时发生的动画效果

1246
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,822
So if you want to animate moving some user doing
所以如果你想对一些用户的移动操作加上动画效果

1247
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:36,224
something else that doesn't happen automatically for you,
加上一些并没有被自动设置出现的动画效果

1248
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,959
which most stuff does with autolayout,
就是那些没有使用自动布局的东西

1249
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:39,728
you can do that here with this method.
你可以在这里用这个方法实现

1250
00:51:43,567 --> 00:51:48,337
Low-memory: didReceiveMemoryWarning
低内存：didReceiveMemoryWarning

1251
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:49,671
will be sent to your view controller when
将在你的系统内存不足时

1252
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,840
the system's low on memory, it's trying to get some back.
发送给你的视图控制器，它想搞一些回来

1253
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,409
This almost never happens.
这种情况基本从不发生

1254
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,311
I just can't remember the last time this happened because
我都不记得上次遇到这种情况是什么时候了

1255
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:57,379
the devices have so much memory these days.
因为现在的设备内存都很大

1256
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:01,116
Usually if this happens though, you wanna pay
但是通常如果发生了这样的事情，你需要

1257
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:03,419
attention because you're using a lot of memory.
注意了，因为你正在使用大量的内存

1258
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:06,055
If the system is sending this to you, either you are or
如果系统发送这个信息给你了，要么是你

1259
00:52:06,124 --> 00:52:07,922
some other app is using a lot of memory.
要么是其他 app 正在使用大量的内存

1260
00:52:07,991 --> 00:52:10,926
By the way, if you are an app that uses a lot of memory, and
如果你的 app 正在使用大量的内存

1261
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:12,094
you don't keep it under control,
而你又不加以控制

1262
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:14,263
the system has the right to just kill you.
那么系统就有权利杀掉你的程序

1263
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,531
Just kill your app.
杀掉你的 app

1264
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,400
And it will do it, absolutely.
它是一定会这么做的

1265
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:19,901
Even if you're in the background,
即使你在后台运行

1266
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:23,805
if you've allocated a ton of memory and you're being a bad
如果你分配了一大吨内存，而你又不控制

1267
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:27,909
citizen they just kill you off to get your memory back what
那么系统就会杀掉你的进程，然后把内存拿回来

1268
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,679
kinda memory would you free up if you got this method.
如果你遇到了这个方法，什么样的内存你可以释放呢？

1269
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,082
Let's say you had an image that's not currently on
我们说如果你有个图片，这个图片现在还不会出现在屏幕上

1270
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,284
screen, and you can create it from a file on disk.
然后你可以通过磁盘上的文件来创建它

1271
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:39,321
We haven't really talked about this, but your phone has
我们还没确切的讨论过这些，但是你的手机是有

1272
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:42,625
permanent storage, flash memory, and you have,
永久存储和闪存的

1273
00:52:42,693 --> 00:52:44,627
let's say a JPEG image, you can just recreate it.
比如一个 JPEG 格式的图片，你完全可以重建它

1274
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:46,461
Well, you would definitely release that here.
那么这样的话，你就完全可以把它释放掉

1275
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,529
Cuz it's not on-screen, and
因为它现在不在屏幕上

1276
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:48,997
you can create it real fast from the disk,
而且你可以非常迅速地通过磁盘上的文件来创建它

1277
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:50,165
so there's no reason to keep it around.
这样的话，把它留在那里就完全没有必要了

1278
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:51,967
So that's something you could release.
这就是一些你可以释放的东西

1279
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:55,003
Basically any memory that you can quickly recreate.
基本上任何你可以快速重建的

1280
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:57,205
Or that is not currently on-screen, and
或者它现在不在屏幕上的

1281
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:59,808
you can create it when that comes back on-screen.
你可以在它会到屏幕上之前再创建

1282
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:02,177
That's a good thing to release.
都是可以释放的内存

1283
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:03,678
But only big things.
但是只释放大的东西

1284
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,947
Don't release little tiny 100 byte things.
不要释放那些小的只有几百字节的东西

1285
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,984
No, we're talking images, sounds, videos,
我们说的都是一些图片啊音频啊视频之类的东西

1286
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:13,355
big ol' things.
大～东西

1287
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:14,556
There's one other little thing:
这还有个小事情要说

1288
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:16,992
it's not part of the view controller life cycle, but
它并不是视图控制器生命周期的一部分

1289
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:20,662
every single object that comes out of a storyboard: views,
但是每一个 Storyboard 创建的对象

1290
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:24,165
view controllers, everything gets sent awakeFromNib and
比如视图和视图控制器，所有的都会被调用 awakeFromNib

1291
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,634
they can send it pretty early.
它们可以非常早的接收到它

1292
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:27,936
Like right as soon as they come
就像它们一出现

1293
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:29,938
out they get sent awake from nib.
就收到了这个 awakeFromNib

1294
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,974
Now you can't use it to like satisfy the requirement that
虽然说你不能在这里满足

1295
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,811
all vars are initialized.
所有的变量都初始化的要求

1296
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,947
But you can use it do early, really early initialization.
但是你可以使用它完成非常早的初始化工作

1297
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:41,350
For example remember I mentioned about you want your
举个例子，我记得我提过关于你如果想要你的

1298
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,819
split view controller to come up showing the face or
分屏视图控制器先出现表情选择列表

1299
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:46,855
come up showing the emotions instead of showing the face?
而不是先出现一张脸

1300
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:48,257
In your calculator,
在你的计算器里

1301
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:49,524
it would come up showing the calculator,
它应该先出现计算器界面

1302
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:52,828
instead of the calculator's graph, and
而不是出现计算的图像

1303
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:54,863
I said you needed to do that by setting the delegate.
然后我说如果想设置这个的话需要设置代理

1304
00:53:54,932 --> 00:53:56,932
This delegate of the SplitViewController,
UISplitViewController 的代理

1305
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,500
that's something you might wanna do to make awakeFromNib
这个可以在 awakeFromNib 中设置

1306
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:00,702
Just really early, get that delegate involved early.
来让代理更早地起作用

1307
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:03,738
We'll talk about delegates on Wednesday.
我们将在周三讲代理

1308
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:07,108
So awake from nib, rarely used and sometimes overused.
所以这个 awakeFromNib，要么基本不用要么过度使用

1309
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:09,878
I would say if you could put it in another method like view
我会这么告诉你们，如果你能把它放在其他方法里，比如

1310
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:11,713
did load or view will appear or view.
viewDidLoad 或者 viewWillAppear 或者

1311
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:13,181
Did layout put it there first.
viewDidLayout，那么就优先把它放在那里

1312
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,717
Don't put it in away fromNib,
不要把它放在 awakeFromNib 里

1313
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:17,185
that's kind of a last resort place to put things.
它就是一个你可以放它的最差的一个地方

1314
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,722
It's probably better than overriding init.
可能比重写构造器好

1315
00:54:19,790 --> 00:54:21,824
But that's the only thing it's better than.
但是也就能比重写构造器好些了

1316
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:25,661
So here's the summary of the entire view controller
这是整个视图控制器

1317
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:26,561
lifecycle.
生命周期的总结

1318
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:30,232
You can instantiated, created out of the storyboard.
你被实例化，从 Stroyboard 中创建

1319
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,734
You get awake from nib sent to you.
你会收到一个 awakeFromNib

1320
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:33,969
Segue prep happens.
完成 Segue 前的准备

1321
00:54:34,038 --> 00:54:36,471
Somebody prepares you if you're being segued to
转场到你之前，其他人会把你准备好

1322
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,407
which most MVC's are.
大部分 MVC 都会这么做

1323
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:39,508
Outlets get set.
出口也都设置好了

1324
00:54:39,577 --> 00:54:41,176
Your face view, and your calculator.
想你的 FaceView 还有你的 Calculator

1325
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,412
It's your display and things like that get set up.
你的 display 和其他要关连都设置好了

1326
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:47,015
ViewDidLoad gets called.
viewDidLoad 被调用

1327
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:49,551
Again, with viewDidLoad, look at all the things that
再一次，看看 viewDidLoad 被调用时

1328
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,453
happened by the time viewDidLoad gets called.
这些事都发生了

1329
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:53,255
It's a great place to put initialization.
这是个非常好进行初始化的地方

1330
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:57,058
You enter kind of the normal life cycle
当你进入到一个常规的生命周期

1331
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,460
where you're getting appearing and disappearing.
在这里你进行“出现”和“消失”操作

1332
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:01,413
Appearing and disappearing with the the will and did,
disappear 和 appear 都有 will 和 did 的

1333
00:55:01,414 --> 00:55:03,298
appears and disappears.
不断出现消失

1334
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:05,501
Along the way, and at any time actually,
在整个过程中的任何时间

1335
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:08,070
even before viewDidLoad, you can get these sent to.
甚至在 viewDidLoad 之前，你都可能收到它们

1336
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,571
Although that would be rare.
虽然这种情况很罕见

1337
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,472
But anytime you can be,
但是也是可能发生的

1338
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:13,308
actually I'm not sure you can get it before viewDidLoad.
事实上我不是特别确定你会不会在 viewDidLoad 之前收到它，先收回那句话

1339
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:16,144
Take that back But any time when view will appear and
但是任何时间 viewWillAppear 和 Disappear发生了

1340
00:55:16,213 --> 00:55:19,314
disappear is happening, whether you're on-screen or
不管你是否出现在屏幕上

1341
00:55:19,383 --> 00:55:22,050
not, you could get viewWillLayout subviews and
你都会得到 viewWillLayoutSubviews 和

1342
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:25,854
viewDidLayout subviews sent to you, auto-layout happening.
viewDidLayoutSubviews 的信息，自动布局会发生

1343
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:28,389
By the way, why would you ever be sent these methods
那么你为什么会在不在屏幕上的情况下

1344
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:29,591
when you're not on-screen?
接收到这些方法呢？

1345
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,327
Well, the system might be preparing to animate you
可能是因为系统正在准备

1346
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:33,429
coming on-screen.
你即将出现在屏幕上的动画效果

1347
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:36,364
When the system animates things,
当系统在进行一些动画效果的时候

1348
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:40,135
one of the ways it can do it is having you draw one
一种它实现的方法是，获取你在一个方向的画面

1349
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,537
orientation, have you draw in the other, and
再获取你在另一个方向画的

1350
00:55:42,606 --> 00:55:45,307
then it kind of moves the bits from one to the other.
然后它就把对应的点移动到另外一个

1351
00:55:45,376 --> 00:55:47,142
That's one kind of animation can do.
这是生成动画效果的一种方式

1352
00:55:47,211 --> 00:55:48,977
So you might be off screen, and it's asking you for
所以这样的话，你可能不在屏幕上，但是它依然会从你这里获取

1353
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:49,544
both of those.
这两个东西

1354
00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:50,712
So it sends you this twice,
所以它会发送给你两次

1355
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:52,547
once to get this orientation and draw, and
第一次获得一个方向下绘制的内容

1356
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:54,950
then once to get this into orientation and draw.
然后第二次获得另一个方向的内容

1357
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,017
And then when you come on screen,
然后等你在屏幕上时

1358
00:55:56,086 --> 00:55:57,786
it animate you from one to the other.
它就会动态地把你从一个移到另一个

1359
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:01,022
So, that's why you can get this at any time
所以这就是为什么你随时都可能得到这个方法

1360
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:01,757
on screen or off.
无论在不在屏幕上

1361
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,995
Also at any time you could get a low memory warning.
同时你也可能在任何时间得到低内存警告

1362
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:08,197
And then you're done.
到这就完事了

1363
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,033
It leaves the heap when it goes off screen if it was
被 segue 到的控制器就会在离开屏幕的同时离开堆

1364
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:18,706
segued to, as long as it's not itself segued into something.
注意不是它 segue 到了另一个控制器

1365
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:21,709
But when it's done it gets thrown out.
如果是被 segue 到的，那就被扔出去了

1366
00:56:21,778 --> 00:56:23,278
Okay, so I'm gonna show you a demo that
现在我要向大家展示一个示例程序

1367
00:56:23,347 --> 00:56:25,247
will make all of this a lot more concrete.
这样可以使我们讲的所有的东西都更具体

1368
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,417
Let me go through the rest of this in case I don't get
我们过一下剩下的这些，万一我不能

1369
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:29,984
back to the slides, I think we will, because
回来讲幻灯片的话，我觉得我们还是会回来的

1370
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,588
I think we're gonna have time to do this other, topic.
因为我觉得我演示完之后还会有些时间来讲另一个主题

1371
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,123
After the demo, I'll come back and
我会回到这里然后

1372
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:37,025
start to talk about memory management, hopefully.
开始讨论一些内存管理，希望如此吧

1373
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:39,995
On Wednesday, extensions, protocols, delegation,
周三，我们会讲扩展（extension）、协议（protocol）和代理（delegation）

1374
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,463
that thing I was telling you you'll need to know for
代理可以用来完成

1375
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:43,932
your split view thing, if you wanna do that extra credit.
分屏视图控制器的加分题

1376
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:46,034
And we'll start talking about scroll view,
然后我们会开始讨论滚动视图

1377
00:56:46,103 --> 00:56:47,302
more complicated object.
更复杂的对象

1378
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,137
On Friday, important one on Friday,
周五，周五很重要

1379
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,805
if you want to do the extra credit,
如果你想在你的图形计算器的性能上

1380
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,241
about performance in the calculator graph.
获得额外的分数

1381
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,377
So you definitely wanna show up for that one.
那你一定要去那天的课

1382
00:56:55,446 --> 00:56:57,813
And then next week we'll start into multi threading,
然后下周我们会开始讨论多线程

1383
00:56:57,882 --> 00:56:59,615
table view, a whole bunch of cool stuff.
UITableView，一连串酷酷的东西

1384
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:03,084
Alright, so let's do this demo here.
那么现在我们来做这个 demo 吧

1385
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:06,788
I'm gonna go to our face view, same thing we were just in,
我要用我们的 FaceView 来做，我们刚刚用过的这个东西

1386
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:08,156
this face it app.
就是这个 FaceIt app

1387
00:57:08,225 --> 00:57:10,959
And I'm gonna drag in a little piece of code I wrote,
然后我要拖进来一小块我写的代码

1388
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:13,428
which I'm gonna show you here.
我要在这里展示给你

1389
00:57:13,497 --> 00:57:17,299
Let's get out navigator back here, put this in here.
我们把导航器拉出来，把它放这

1390
00:57:17,368 --> 00:57:18,600
So I'm just gonna drop this in here.
我就把它丢在这里

1391
00:57:18,668 --> 00:57:20,202
By the way when you drag in code,
顺便一提，当你拖拽代码时

1392
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:22,537
you probably want to do copy items, if needed.
你可能会想用这个 Copy items if needed

1393
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:24,639
Otherwise, it's gonna be kind of linked to the other one,
要不然它只会是快捷方式

1394
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:25,874
if you change it in the other place,
如果你在其他地方对它做了些改动

1395
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,242
it's gonna be changing here.
那么这里的也会相应变化

1396
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:30,712
Can be kinda causing unexpected results often.
这样的话可能经常会导致很多预期之外的后果

1397
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:32,781
I put this in here.
我把这个放这

1398
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:34,782
Let's look at this little class I just dropped in here,
我们来看看我刚刚丢在这里的这个小类

1399
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,951
it's called VCLLoggingViewController.
它叫做 VCLLoggingViewController

1400
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,054
It's a subclass of UIViewController.
他是 UIViewController 的一个子类

1401
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:44,292
VCLLoggingViewController. And it logs the VCL methods. 
它会记录 VCL 的方法

1402
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:46,661
View controller life cycle methods.
视图控制器（VC）生命周期(L)方法

1403
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:50,431
So it basically just overrides every single one.
所以它基本上就是重写了每一个方法

1404
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,435
View will appear, view layout subviews, awake from nib.
viewWillAppear, viewWillLayoutSubviews, awakeFromNib

1405
00:57:53,504 --> 00:57:55,436
It even tells you when it left the heap.
它甚至可以告诉你它什么时候离开堆

1406
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:57,372
It's overriding init here, and
它在这重写了一个构造器

1407
00:57:57,441 --> 00:58:00,942
it just prints out what happened.
它就是把发生了什么打印出来

1408
00:58:01,011 --> 00:58:02,210
So it just sits there on the console,
它就在控制台那里

1409
00:58:02,279 --> 00:58:04,179
printing out everything that happened.
打印所有发生的事情

1410
00:58:04,248 --> 00:58:05,147
It's a little bit cool,
还是挺酷的

1411
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,048
because it shows you the instance of each of them.
因为它会告诉你它们的每个实例都发生了什么

1412
00:58:07,117 --> 00:58:09,351
So you can see instances coming and going,
所以你可以看到实例们出现然后消失

1413
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,054
as they get segued to, and then come off.
被 segue 到，然后又离去

1414
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:15,390
It also kinda indents it over time, so you can, when you
每当过去一段时间，它会增加缩进

1415
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:18,259
click some, you can see a bunch that happen together.
你进行操作的时候，可以看到一连串发生的事情

1416
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,196
Now the way we're gonna use this is we're just gonna make
我们使用它的方式就是

1417
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:26,868
this class be the super class of both of our controllers.
把它变成我们两个控制器的父类

1418
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:29,304
So we're gonna make that into a VCL login view controller.
也就是把它们变成 VCLLoggingViewController

1419
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:32,674
And we're gonna make this into a VCL login view controller.
把这个 UIViewController 改成 VCLLoggingViewController

1420
00:58:32,743 --> 00:58:36,411
And right there, you can see why we always wanna call super
然后这里，你就明白为什么在所有视图控制器方法中

1421
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:38,713
in all of our view control methods.
我们总是要调用 super 了

1422
00:58:38,782 --> 00:58:40,648
Cuz if we did any of these view controller
如果任何一个控制器生命周期

1423
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:41,850
life cycle methods, and
的方法被调用了

1424
00:58:41,918 --> 00:58:44,385
we were subclassing from VCL login view controller,
同时我们继承了 VCLLoggingViewController

1425
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,788
if we don't call super, it not gonna get logged.
但我们不调用 super，那么就不会被记录

1426
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,890
And it's not unusual to come along later and
这并不罕见，随时可能

1427
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,759
pop the different kind of view controller in between you and
在你和 UIViewController 之间

1428
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:52,894
UI view controller.
插入一个其他的类

1429
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:56,264
Some view controller that does something like logging or
比如用来记录的视图控制器

1430
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:57,732
something else.
或者其他的什么

1431
00:58:57,801 --> 00:58:58,867
All right, so that's it.
好啦 就是这样

1432
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:00,501
That's all we need to do to make this work.
这就是我们为了让它工作所做的所有的事情

1433
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:01,369
So I'm gonna go ahead and
所以我要继续了

1434
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:03,137
run, we'll stick with iPhone 7 plus.
我们在 iPhone 7 Plus 上运行

1435
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:07,009
Let's go ahead and get the console up here.
我们来看看，把这个控制台往上拉

1436
00:59:10,748 --> 00:59:11,546
Here we go.
来吧

1437
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:13,414
This came up, and we're already seeing a lot of
它们出现了，我们已经看到了很多

1438
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:15,783
view controller lifecycle stuff happening here.
视图控制器生命周期的东西出现了

1439
00:59:15,852 --> 00:59:17,852
All right, we have our EmotionsViewController and
我们这里有我们的 EmotionsViewController 和

1440
00:59:17,921 --> 00:59:18,920
our FaceViewController,
我们的 FaceViewController

1441
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:21,623
these two view controllers get emitted.
这两个视图控制器出现了

1442
00:59:21,692 --> 00:59:23,458
They come out of the storyboard, and
它们从 Storyboard 中被初始化

1443
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:25,426
they initialize with this init with coder.
它们通过这个 init(coder:) 来初始化

1444
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,594
And that's the one that is for things
这个构造器是给

1445
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:27,862
come out the interface builder.
Interface Builder 中的东西用的

1446
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:31,033
They both get awakeFromNib, you see that?
它们都被调用了 awakeFromNib，你看见了么？

1447
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:34,435
And then the emotions one, first, gets viewDidLoad.
EmotionViewController 先获得 viewDidLoad

1448
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:37,371
Then it gets viewwillAppear(animated = false)
然后它有个 viewwillAppear(animated = false）

1449
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:38,990
That's because we're 
这是因为

1450
00:59:38,991 --> 00:59:40,541
just starting up our app,
我们才开始运行我们的 app

1451
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:43,678
so it's not sliding in on a navigation controller or something.
并不是滑入一个导航控制器或者别的什么东西

1452
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,848
It's just appearing, so it's not animated.
它就简单的出现了，所以并没有动画效果

1453
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:50,919
Then notice, it gets laid out twice, both at the same size,
这里注意，它布局了两次，都在相同的尺寸下

1454
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:54,622
295 x 414, which is this size right here.
295 x 414，就是现在这个尺寸

1455
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:56,624
It gets look, done twice.
它做了两次

1456
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:57,642
Again, Why?
所以到底是为什么呢？

1457
00:59:57,643 --> 00:59:58,592
Some animation, I don't know wha's going on,
可能是一些动画效果？我并不知道

1458
00:59:58,661 --> 00:59:59,494
why i's doing that.
它为什么这么做

1459
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:00,662
But you don't care,
但是你不必在意

1460
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:04,466
just be careful that those layouts can happen repeatedly.
只要注意，这些布局可能频繁的发生

1461
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:06,902
Now here is face view controller, it gets loaded.
现在这是个 FaceViewController，他已经被加载好了

1462
01:00:08,505 --> 01:00:10,838
It's told it's going to appear, it will appear.
它被告知将要出现了，willAppear

1463
01:00:10,907 --> 01:00:12,274
And it gets laid out once.
而且它被布局了一次

1464
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:17,479
Then they both get DidAppear, and now they're on screen.
然后它们现在都有了 didAppear，然后它们现在都在屏幕上了

1465
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:19,181
So this is kind of exactly what you'd expect.
这完全就是如我们所预想的

1466
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:24,252
Now let's rotate this thing, so
现在我们来旋转一下设备

1467
01:00:24,321 --> 01:00:26,821
that we go to portrait mode.
这样我们就来到了纵向模式

1468
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:29,090
And we're not gonna see the master.
然后我们就看不见主视图了

1469
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:33,428
We're only gonna see the details here.
我们只能看见这里的细节

1470
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:37,765
So here, the master disappears.
所以这里，主视图消失了

1471
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,334
So this is, see the dash?
看见这些下划线了么？

1472
01:00:39,403 --> 01:00:42,570
That's what happened when I did that rotation.
这就是在我旋转设备的时候发生了什么

1473
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,839
So this is all the new stuff.
所以这些都是新的东西

1474
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:46,374
Now notice that the EmotionViewController
现在注意力放在 EmotionViewController 上

1475
01:00:46,443 --> 01:00:47,142
immediately is
它立即被

1476
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:50,678
told that there's going to be a rotation animation.
告知，这里即将出现一个旋转设备相关的动画效果

1477
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:54,049
And it gets a chance to participate in the animation.
然后它就有了参与这个动画效果的机会

1478
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:58,719
The FaceView gets re-laid out in its new size.
这个 FaceView 在它的新尺寸下被重新布局了

1479
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,322
It's tall now, so it gets laid out, so
它现在高了，所以它被布局好了

1480
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,124
it gets viewWillLayoutSubviews.
它获得了 viewWillLayoutSubviews

1481
01:01:03,193 --> 01:01:05,927
The Emotions Controller is told that it will disappear.
EmotionsViewController 被告知它要消失了

1482
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,164
So it's going to disappear.
所以它就要消失了

1483
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:11,766
Notice the animated = false, that's cuz the animation in
注意这个 animated = false，这是因为旋转时的动画

1484
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:15,403
that rotation case is handled by the rotation animation.
是交给旋转动画效果处理的

1485
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:18,373
So it's not sliding in or out but it is getting animated
所以它并不是滑入滑出，他的动画效果

1486
01:01:18,442 --> 01:01:21,109
out of there but by the rotation animation.
是由旋转动画效果来呈现的

1487
01:01:21,178 --> 01:01:21,943
Then we have
然后我们的

1488
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,212
the face view controller being laid out again.
FaceViewController 又被重新布局了

1489
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:30,952
Now we're getting the EmotionsViewControllers
现在 EmotionsViewController

1490
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:32,487
being getting it's chance to
获得了机会参与设置

1491
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:35,389
animate alongside the rotation, right here.
旋转时的动画效果了，就这里

1492
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:37,693
We've got a couple of spurious things here from
这里是 iOS UIKit 的胡言乱语

1493
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:41,829
the iOS new UIKit, we can get rid of those.
我们完全不用管它们

1494
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:46,134
And then the animation ends for both of those controllers.
然后两个控制器的动画效果结束了

1495
01:01:46,203 --> 01:01:47,069
Make sense?
说得通吧？

1496
01:01:47,137 --> 01:01:49,604
Now I'm gonna click this emotions thing, and
现在我要来点击一下这个 Emotions

1497
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:52,941
go back to the master and watch what happens.
然后回到主视图看看会发生什么

1498
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,743
Okay, so we go back to the master.

1499
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:57,812
FaceViewController was told it would disappear,

1500
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,382
of course, cuz it did, does disappear.

1501
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,718
The emotions one is told that it will appear,

1502
01:02:02,786 --> 01:02:05,553
it's laid out in this new tall arrangement.

1503
01:02:05,622 --> 01:02:07,154
And then the face view controller told it,

1504
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,623
was disappeared and

1505
01:02:08,692 --> 01:02:10,759
the emotion view controller was told it disappeared.

1506
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,829
Now let's go, bring one back.

1507
01:02:14,898 --> 01:02:18,633
You can see, look, FaceViewController(2).

1508
01:02:18,702 --> 01:02:20,835
A new FaceViewController was created,

1509
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:24,138
because we segued to it, so it created it.

1510
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:25,139
You see that?

1511
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:28,676
And in fact, if we go back and forth, we'll see that we're

1512
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:31,413
getting new FaceViewControllers each time,

1513
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:33,148
FaceView three.

1514
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,984
And look at the old one's, FaceViewController

1515
01:02:36,053 --> 01:02:39,254
3 left heap, they're gonna thrown out beneath.

1516
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:43,725
So I'll be posting all this code.

1517
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:45,693
You can drop this logging view controller.

1518
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,162
Actually you can drop it into your calculator,

1519
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,899
if you wanted, and try and watch it bring things on and

1520
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:52,033
off screen etc.

1521
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:58,439
Let's go back to the slides here.

1522
01:02:58,508 --> 01:03:02,243
Let's talk about our next topic,

1523
01:03:02,312 --> 01:03:06,214
which is memory management.

1524
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:08,983
We've kind of avoided this topic so far but

1525
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:10,918
i's an important topping topic.

1526
01:03:10,987 --> 01:03:13,154
If you have a reference counted data structure,

1527
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:14,822
a class tha's the only reference,

1528
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:17,458
well i's not the only data counting reference structure

1529
01:03:17,527 --> 01:03:18,994
as you'll see in a second.

1530
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:22,263
But if you have a reference counting thing, and it lives

1531
01:03:22,332 --> 01:03:26,167
in the heap, how do you know when to get rid of it?

1532
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:29,136
We saw in that demo I just did the faceview controller

1533
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:30,505
left the heap.

1534
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:32,507
How did it know to leave the heap?

1535
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:35,810
Because we don't do anything to tell it to leave the heap.

1536
01:03:35,879 --> 01:03:37,645
We just are using it, and

1537
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:40,147
when we're not using it anymore it goes away.

1538
01:03:40,216 --> 01:03:43,217
Well, of course, you know one way to make things leave

1539
01:03:43,286 --> 01:03:45,419
the heap, it's called garbage collection.

1540
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:47,021
How many people know what garbage collection is,

1541
01:03:47,090 --> 01:03:48,890
have heard that phrase before?

1542
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51,225
So, more than half of you, so that's good.

1543
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:55,330
Runtimes like Java, do garbage collection.

1544
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,065
It's a perfectly fine way to do it.

1545
01:03:58,134 --> 01:03:59,767
It involves going through the heap and

1546
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,602
kind of marking the use of everything and

1547
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:02,804
then sweeping through and

1548
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:05,740
getting rid of stuff that's not used.

1549
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:08,376
Swift doesn't do any of that, it uses a totally different

1550
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:11,613
mechanism called Automatic Reference Counting.

1551
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:13,815
Basically every time you create a var or

1552
01:04:13,884 --> 01:04:16,551
a let that points to something in a heap,

1553
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:19,754
Swift goes over somewhere and makes a mark.

1554
01:04:19,823 --> 01:04:21,322
And another one, there's another one.

1555
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:24,025
And it keeps track of it until there aren't anymore of those

1556
01:04:24,094 --> 01:04:25,426
lets and vars.

1557
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:28,629
It erases them as those vars go away.

1558
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,664
Like, maybe they're

1559
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:32,066
a var in another object that leaves the heap.

1560
01:04:32,135 --> 01:04:34,735
So now that var is no longer pointing to this other object.

1561
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:37,438
So it's basically keeping track of all the vars unless

1562
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:38,539
they point to something in the heap.

1563
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:40,475
And when no one points to any more,

1564
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:42,477
it lets it out of the heap.

1565
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,045
Now why is this good?

1566
01:04:44,114 --> 01:04:45,880
It's very predictable memory usage.

1567
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:48,249
You know exactly when things are gonna leave the heap.

1568
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:51,519
They leave the heap as soon as nobody points to them anymore.

1569
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:53,821
What's also great about it, is that you almost have to

1570
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,389
do nothing in your code to make this work.

1571
01:04:55,458 --> 01:04:56,657
It's just automatic.

1572
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:59,293
That's why it's called automatic reference counting.

1573
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,262
You can get involved however.

1574
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:04,131
And the way you can get involved is by influencing

1575
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,501
the way that arc works.

1576
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:09,003
And you do that with three keywords in Swift

1577
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:12,072
called strong, weak and unowned.

1578
01:05:12,141 --> 01:05:14,876
And I actually told you and I was gonna tell you about these

1579
01:05:14,945 --> 01:05:17,445
back in the very first lecture, you remember when we

1580
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:20,081
made the outlet for display, it was weak.

1581
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:20,615
Remember that?

1582
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:22,850
That's this weak right here.

1583
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,619
So the strong, weak and unknown.

1584
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,287
So let's talk about each of those.

1585
01:05:26,356 --> 01:05:29,390
Strong, this is normal reference counting.

1586
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:31,692
If you have a strong var or

1587
01:05:31,761 --> 01:05:34,629
strong let to something in the heap, then that thing

1588
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:37,398
will stay in the heap, as long as that var exists,

1589
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:40,968
it's strongly holding that thing in the heap.

1590
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:42,102
This is the default.

1591
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:45,773
You don't even ever type this keyword, cuz it's the default.

1592
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:49,244
Every var, unless you say it's weak, is going to be strong.

1593
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:51,913
So it's simple.

1594
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,448
Works magically.

1595
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:54,215
Then there's weak.

1596
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,652
Now weak is a really interesting keyword in Swift.

1597
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,188
When you put weak on top of a var,

1598
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:05,193
it says, well I'm looking at this thing in the heap but

1599
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:07,762
if no one else is interested in the heap then

1600
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:10,298
you can throw it out of the heap and set me to nil.

1601
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:13,034
So weak only works with what type?

1602
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:17,372
>> Optional. >> Optional, exactly,

1603
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:19,907
cuz you have to be able to set it to nil.

1604
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:22,376
So only optionals can be weak.

1605
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:26,514
So the display outlet in your calculator,

1606
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:31,486
it was a weak UI label exclamation point,

1607
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:34,722
which means it was an optional UI label.

1608
01:06:34,791 --> 01:06:35,523
And so it was weak.

1609
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:36,357
So what does that mean?

1610
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:38,326
That means if that UI label for

1611
01:06:38,395 --> 01:06:41,929
some reason ever, everyone else threw it out,

1612
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:46,167
then that display var would be set to nil, automatically.

1613
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:50,138
Now, why does that display var set itself weak?

1614
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,672
Why does it say weak?

1615
01:06:51,741 --> 01:06:54,442
Well, because the thing it's pointing to is that view

1616
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,376
hierarchy.

1617
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:57,778
The view hierarchy that has all the calculator buttons and

1618
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,013
the display and all in there.

1619
01:06:59,082 --> 01:07:02,149
And if that view hierarchy stops pointing to it,

1620
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:06,020
that means it's gone, and so the display outlet is no

1621
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:09,457
longer interested in trying to set numbers in it, and

1622
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,393
things like that, because it's gone.

1623
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:16,297
So, when you have a var that points into a very strongly

1624
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:19,033
held data structure that you completely depend on for

1625
01:07:19,102 --> 01:07:21,702
your semantic meaning to mean anything

1626
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:22,670
then you can make it weak.

1627
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:28,442
And so we're perfectly fine if that display gets at the nil

1628
01:07:28,511 --> 01:07:31,679
if the view hierarchy no longer points to that UI label

1629
01:07:31,748 --> 01:07:33,815
because it's probably meaningless at that point.

1630
01:07:36,153 --> 01:07:39,053
So we don't usually use weak that much.

1631
01:07:39,122 --> 01:07:41,989
A lot of times we'll use it to keep from having

1632
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:44,159
one object pointing to another strongly and

1633
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:46,361
having that object point back to this one strongly.

1634
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:48,829
That's very bad situation.

1635
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,365
That's called a memory cycle.

1636
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:54,101
That's gonna keep both of those objects in the heap

1637
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,304
forever, because there's always gonna be a strong

1638
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:58,806
pointer to each of them.

1639
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:00,108
Cuz they each point to each other.

1640
01:08:00,177 --> 01:08:01,776
So either of them can leave the heap and

1641
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:03,210
free up their pointer to the other one.

1642
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:04,245
Unless you set one,

1643
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:06,647
like they're optionally set one to nil or something.

1644
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:07,882
So if you had a situation like that,

1645
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:10,018
you could use weak to break that cycle by having one

1646
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:12,487
of the pointers be a weak pointer.

1647
01:08:12,556 --> 01:08:14,089
That would allow it possibly to happen.

1648
01:08:15,525 --> 01:08:17,024
And I'm gonna show you an example here of another

1649
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,928
case where making that kind of memory cycle is super easy.

1650
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:21,929
And that's bad that it's easy.

1651
01:08:21,998 --> 01:08:23,865
Because you can get the cycles where things are being

1652
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,099
held in memory.

1653
01:08:25,168 --> 01:08:27,034
The last one is unowned.

1654
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:30,471
Unowned means, "Hey, automatic reference counter, Don't worry

1655
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,708
about this one, I'll take care of it, I'll make sure I never

1656
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,477
use it when it's not pointing to something in the heap".

1657
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:38,746
This one can be quite dangerous.

1658
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:40,381
We almost never use this.

1659
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:42,916
It would really only be used to break one of these memory

1660
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:45,586
cycles, and it can only be used to make a memory cycle

1661
01:08:45,655 --> 01:08:48,723
when you're 100% sure that you know who's

1662
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:51,292
using that pointer, because automatic reference counting

1663
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:53,694
is not going to be counting it as a strong reference, and

1664
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:55,296
it's also not going to check.

1665
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:58,099
And so if you use it, and that thing you're pointing to

1666
01:08:58,168 --> 01:09:01,702
has left the heap, it will crash your program.

1667
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:02,970
So that's what unowned is.

1668
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:05,206
Now, since unowned just crashes your program if you

1669
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:06,474
try to use it and it's not in the heap,

1670
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:07,108
it's not an optional.

1671
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:09,344
There is no setting to nil,

1672
01:09:09,412 --> 01:09:11,479
it's always assumed to not be nil.

1673
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:12,980
And if it's ever nil and

1674
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:15,716
that code executes, bam, it crashes.

1675
01:09:15,785 --> 01:09:17,018
So unowned,

1676
01:09:17,087 --> 01:09:18,987
I will show you how we use unowned in a moment.

1677
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,890
It's only to break cycles.

1678
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:26,927
Now, closures have an interesting attribute

1679
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,530
about them, which hopefully you read about in your reading

1680
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:32,867
assignment, that really has a lot to do with this strong,

1681
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:35,369
weak, and unowned business.

1682
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:38,839
And then what goes on inside of a closure is that a closure

1683
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:44,678
captures all the references inside of it.

1684
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:48,983
It captures them, and makes a strong pointer to them.

1685
01:09:49,052 --> 01:09:51,219
So, if you reference something inside a closure,

1686
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:52,954
remember what closures are.

1687
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:53,821
Open curly braces, and

1688
01:09:53,889 --> 01:09:55,557
we have some code in there like we had in our

1689
01:09:57,093 --> 01:09:59,093
operations table of our calculator brain.

1690
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:00,294
So inside that closure,

1691
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:03,597
inside those curly braces you reference some reference type,

1692
01:10:03,666 --> 01:10:05,066
something that's in the heap.

1693
01:10:05,135 --> 01:10:07,968
That closure is itself a reference type.

1694
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:09,737
It lives in the heap and

1695
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,573
it's going to keep a strong pointer to the other thing.

1696
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:15,142
And the problem comes if that other thing has a strong

1697
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,378
pointer back to that closure.

1698
01:10:17,447 --> 01:10:18,846
Because now you have a memory cycle.

1699
01:10:18,915 --> 01:10:21,148
The closure is keeping that object in and that object that

1700
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:23,350
has a pointer to the closure is keeping the closure in.

1701
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,119
They are keeping each other in memory.

1702
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:27,422
Now neither of them can ever leave.

1703
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:31,392
It's called a memory cycle and it's really easier memory

1704
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,928
cycle in a closure, as you'll see.

1705
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:36,463
So, here is an example with our calculator.

1706
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:39,466
Let's say I added a new method to my calculator brain called

1707
01:10:39,535 --> 01:10:42,469
addUnaryOperation where I allow people to

1708
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:45,072
add new operations to my operations table.

1709
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,941
Right now we don't allow that because it's all private.

1710
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,344
But let's say I had a public method, addUnaryOperation.

1711
01:10:50,413 --> 01:10:51,846
You could add a new operation.

1712
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:52,680
Wouldn't that be cool?

1713
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:55,449
Yeah, that would be cool.

1714
01:10:55,518 --> 01:10:56,917
Let's see what it would like for

1715
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:58,953
a view controller that wanted to, for

1716
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,523
example, add a unary operation which is square root, but

1717
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,192
it turns the display green.

1718
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:06,794
I call it green square root.

1719
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:08,963
So, what will it look like to write something like that?

1720
01:11:09,032 --> 01:11:11,598
Well, I would call addUnaryOperation,

1721
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:12,967
give it some symbol.

1722
01:11:13,036 --> 01:11:15,636
I'm gonna have it look like a green square root but

1723
01:11:15,705 --> 01:11:19,139
it's pushing it there but it's kind of what it looks like.

1724
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:21,742
And it would pass in the operation for

1725
01:11:21,811 --> 01:11:23,110
green square root.

1726
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:26,213
Now just a couple of cleanup things before that here.

1727
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,783
This is that operation argument to addUnary

1728
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:29,816
operation.

1729
01:11:29,885 --> 01:11:34,755
And as we know, we could use trailing

1730
01:11:34,824 --> 01:11:38,626
closure syntax here to get rid of that operation colon.

1731
01:11:38,695 --> 01:11:41,328
We just close it, and since the closure is the last

1732
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,464
argument, we just put it after the end of the parenthesis.

1733
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:46,033
Remember that from when I talked about filter and map?

1734
01:11:46,102 --> 01:11:48,102
So we could do that here, so that cleans it up.

1735
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:49,871
Also, of course,

1736
01:11:49,939 --> 01:11:55,709
we could let Swift infer the types here and just use $0.

1737
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:57,311
Everyone understand this code up here?

1738
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:58,446
Could not be simpler, right?

1739
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:01,282
I'm just adding this Unary operation, green square root.

1740
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,851
And all it's doing is setting, this, I'm doing this from

1741
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,387
my view controller, so it's setting the displays color to

1742
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,021
green And returning square roots,

1743
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:10,458
the same as square root, but the display is just green.

1744
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:11,859
Now, this will not compile.

1745
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:14,528
Why will this not compile?

1746
01:12:14,597 --> 01:12:16,263
Let us look and see why not.

1747
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:21,035
It's because it's gonna say you have to explicitly say

1748
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:25,072
self dot there because I want you to understand that you

1749
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:32,113
are capturing a strong pointer to yourself In this closure.

1750
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:37,618
So that in case somehow you point to this closure,

1751
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:39,353
which our view controller does,

1752
01:12:39,422 --> 01:12:41,388
because our view controller has the calculator brain,

1753
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,224
calculator brain has the operations table,

1754
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:45,493
the operations table has this closure in it.

1755
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,363
So I'm pointing to that indirectly

1756
01:12:49,432 --> 01:12:52,333
from my View Controller, and it's pointing now back at me.

1757
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:54,702
Self dot, it's gonna capture self.

1758
01:12:54,771 --> 01:12:57,371
Self is a pointer to myself, my own View Controller.

1759
01:12:57,440 --> 01:12:58,338
Now I've created a memory cycle.

1760
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,007
Yep.

1761
01:13:00,076 --> 01:13:01,476
Everyone understand what's going on there?

1762
01:13:02,612 --> 01:13:03,810
The closure lives in the heap.

1763
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:05,279
The View Controller lives in the heap.

1764
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:06,547
They're now pointing to each other.

1765
01:13:07,784 --> 01:13:09,049
The closure's pointing directly to the view

1766
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,717
controller and the view controller's indirectly

1767
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,453
pointing to the closure through the calculator brain,

1768
01:13:12,522 --> 01:13:13,721
through the operations table.

1769
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:18,092
This operation they've gotta add in.

1770
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,794
So let's talk about how we break this cycle

1771
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:20,628
because since it's so

1772
01:13:20,697 --> 01:13:23,231
easy to do we need to be able to break it easily as well.

1773
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,167
Well first thing we're going to do,

1774
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:29,670
is we're going to create a special local variable.

1775
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:32,973
So closures allow you to before the word in,

1776
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:36,177
put open square bracket, a list of special variables.

1777
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,479
These are just little local variables that just live for

1778
01:13:38,548 --> 01:13:40,580
this closure only.

1779
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:42,650
Now these variables can have any name.

1780
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,353
And you can set them to any value you want that's in

1781
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,554
the scope here.

1782
01:13:46,623 --> 01:13:48,922
So I've created a local variable called me and

1783
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:50,691
I've set it equal to self.

1784
01:13:52,128 --> 01:13:54,161
So that's fine, "me" is a local variable,

1785
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:56,430
it's going to be of type view controller,

1786
01:13:56,499 --> 01:13:58,866
it's added to myself and so now I can use me in there and

1787
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:01,702
you already used self so I've replaced self with me.

1788
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:03,704
That doesn't help break our cycle at all.

1789
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:08,442
However, what if I made that me variable,

1790
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,711
not self but me, be unowned?

1791
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,615
If I make that thing be unowned,

1792
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:17,652
now it's not going to create that strong pointer.

1793
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:21,488
Because me It lives in the heap, but

1794
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:24,024
automatic reference counting doesn't reference count it, so

1795
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:25,592
it pays no attention to it.

1796
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:27,294
Now what that would mean though,

1797
01:14:27,363 --> 01:14:30,397
is that if this code were executed, and me,

1798
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,133
which is the view controller cuz I set it equal to self, if

1799
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:36,570
the view controller were out of the heap, this would crash.

1800
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:37,838
But that's perfectly fine here.

1801
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:40,207
Do you see why that's fine?

1802
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:43,511
When would a calculator operation ever be executed

1803
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,846
if the view controller is not even in the heap?

1804
01:14:45,914 --> 01:14:46,814
It's impossible.

1805
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,450
The view controller provides all the UI that causes this

1806
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:50,284
thing to be executed.

1807
01:14:50,353 --> 01:14:52,286
There's absolutely no way that can happen, so

1808
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:55,122
it's perfectly fine to say unowned here.

1809
01:14:55,191 --> 01:14:57,891
And that would break the cycle nicely.

1810
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,194
But let's talk about another way to do it.

1811
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:02,396
By the way, it doesn't have to be called 'me',

1812
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:04,531
I could say 'unknown self' equals 'self'.

1813
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,600
In other words, the local variable can shadow or

1814
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:09,804
have the same name as the more global variable 'self'.

1815
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:11,972
So I could say unknown self equals self, and

1816
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,508
in fact if I just say unknown self that's the same as

1817
01:15:14,576 --> 01:15:16,344
saying 'unknown self equals self.

1818
01:15:16,412 --> 01:15:18,245
So this is a lot of times how we'll break a cycle,

1819
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:20,815
we'll say unknown self and that basically means inside

1820
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:24,385
this enclosure, you can assume that self is in the heap.

1821
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,190
Now let's talk about breaking it with weak.

1822
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:32,293
So I can also say weak self.

1823
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:35,062
And that means that self is now a local variable in this

1824
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:37,964
closure that's an optional view controller.

1825
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:41,935
And if it's not, if that view controller is not in the heap,

1826
01:15:42,004 --> 01:15:45,872
this variable self, which is different from the global cell

1827
01:15:45,941 --> 01:15:47,107
is going to be nil.

1828
01:15:47,176 --> 01:15:48,875
So this is a safe way to do it.

1829
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:51,111
But of course since it's an optional,

1830
01:15:51,180 --> 01:15:53,147
we can't just say self.display,

1831
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,617
right there we have to say optional chained self.display.

1832
01:15:56,686 --> 01:15:58,385
So that if this closure executes and

1833
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:01,288
the view controller is not in the heap, self question mark

1834
01:16:01,357 --> 01:16:04,792
will be nil and it will not execute the rest of that line.

1835
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:06,093
It'll still return the square root,

1836
01:16:06,162 --> 01:16:08,695
but it won't turn the thing green because

1837
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:10,031
this view controller's not even there.

1838
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,867
So that's how we can use weak to do it.

1839
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:16,604
And sometimes we use weak, and we could create anther

1840
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:18,071
variable, and often we'll do this.

1841
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:19,907
This might be the most common way to do it right here,

1842
01:16:19,976 --> 01:16:22,877
is to say weak weakself equals self.

1843
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:25,045
And so, weakself is this Argument,

1844
01:16:25,114 --> 01:16:27,514
is this local variable inside the closure only

1845
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:29,216
that is a weak version of Self.

1846
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,819
Okay, that's kind of clearer

1847
01:16:31,888 --> 01:16:33,687
what's going on than if you just say weakSelf.

1848
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:36,290
Then it's like self is an optional, it's weird.

1849
01:16:36,358 --> 01:16:37,791
Now at least you have a different variable called

1850
01:16:37,860 --> 01:16:40,927
weakSelf, all right.

1851
01:16:40,996 --> 01:16:43,130
Okay, so let's go in the last couple minutes and

1852
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:44,464
just do this in the Calculator.

1853
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:47,334
Let's do exactly what I talked about, this green square root.

1854
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:50,437
I'm just gonna go back to our calculator here.

1855
01:16:50,506 --> 01:16:52,173
Where is our calculator?

1856
01:16:52,241 --> 01:16:53,474
Here somewhere.

1857
01:16:53,543 --> 01:16:54,708
There it is.

1858
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:55,943
We haven't seen this code in a while.

1859
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,011
You've seen it a lot.

1860
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:58,712
I haven't seen it in a long time.

1861
01:16:58,781 --> 01:16:59,946
All right, so here's our calculator, and

1862
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:03,483
I told you I'm just going to add this new func.

1863
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,886
Add unary operation.

1864
01:17:07,023 --> 01:17:11,124
And it's going to take the symbol that we

1865
01:17:11,193 --> 01:17:13,660
want to have it be this in there, so it's gonna be like

1866
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:16,564
the green square root, or whatever we call it there.

1867
01:17:16,632 --> 01:17:19,033
And actually, probably we wanna say something like named

1868
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:21,902
symbol, that's probably be a little better naming there,

1869
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,136
and that's a string.

1870
01:17:23,205 --> 01:17:25,439
And it's going to take an argument,

1871
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:28,976
let's make more space here, which is the operation.

1872
01:17:29,045 --> 01:17:31,111
We don't really need to have an external name because we're

1873
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:36,416
probably gonna use trailing closure syntax there to do it.

1874
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:39,887
But this is just a Double, returns a Double function.

1875
01:17:39,956 --> 01:17:43,256
Hopefully, you're all very familiar by now with using

1876
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,493
a function just as a type right there.

1877
01:17:46,829 --> 01:17:48,061
So we have this UnaryOperation.

1878
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:50,564
And all we need to do to make this work is

1879
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:52,366
we have our operations table down here.

1880
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:57,304
I'm just gonna say operations sub that symbol =

1881
01:17:57,373 --> 01:18:00,541
Operation.unary operation,

1882
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:04,978
where this operation is the argument.

1883
01:18:05,047 --> 01:18:06,680
I mean, it couldn't be simpler.

1884
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:09,383
Really, that was so simple because we built such a good

1885
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:12,786
data structure here to store all of our operations.

1886
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:15,388
Now notice we have an error here.

1887
01:18:15,457 --> 01:18:17,424
You see this has an error.

1888
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:18,124
What's it saying?

1889
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,660
Mark this method mutating.

1890
01:18:19,729 --> 01:18:20,895
Okay, why is that?

1891
01:18:20,963 --> 01:18:23,663
Well that's because we're changing this operations table

1892
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:25,499
so of course that has to be mutating.

1893
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:28,635
But that's not the only error, we've got another error.

1894
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:29,837
What's this saying?

1895
01:18:29,906 --> 01:18:33,173
It's saying here that this parameter operation

1896
01:18:33,242 --> 01:18:34,508
Is "escaping".

1897
01:18:34,577 --> 01:18:38,011
What that does that mean, it's escaping?

1898
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,613
Let's go ahead and fix it.

1899
01:18:39,682 --> 01:18:43,417
It puts this word in here, @escaping.

1900
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:46,753
Escaping means that this function,

1901
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:50,558
is escaping these curly braces.

1902
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,128
It is in fact escaping.

1903
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:55,362
Where is it escaping?

1904
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:56,497
It's jumping into here.

1905
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,602
Anytime you have a function that you pass in, and

1906
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:04,338
it gets put in some other data structure, in other words,

1907
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:08,208
it escapes out of the curly braces of the method it's in,

1908
01:19:08,277 --> 01:19:11,344
you have to mark it escaping so that you understand and

1909
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,682
swift understands that you are storing that somewhere.

1910
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,750
And that's because it might create a memory cycle

1911
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:18,785
if you do that.

1912
01:19:18,854 --> 01:19:20,954
So fix it will automatically remind you about this so

1913
01:19:21,023 --> 01:19:22,790
you don't have to remember that so much.

1914
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:24,691
We've got this nice cool new feature and

1915
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,962
let's go to our view controller and add it.

1916
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:30,431
Hey how about we use view did load.

1917
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,201
Here's view did load, super dot view did load.

1918
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:36,002
I never want to forget that.

1919
01:19:36,071 --> 01:19:38,738
So that's going to happen we're all initialized,

1920
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:40,140
our outlets are set.

1921
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:43,143
Let's just go ahead and call that addUnaryOperation here.

1922
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:49,182
Let's call it brain addUnaryOperation.

1923
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:50,984
Is that what I called it?

1924
01:19:51,053 --> 01:19:55,522
addUnaryOperation, I don't know why that's not,

1925
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:56,357
there it did it.

1926
01:19:57,426 --> 01:19:58,692
It's just a little slow.

1927
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:03,263
addUnaryOperation takes the symbol which is named.

1928
01:20:03,332 --> 01:20:04,631
And I'm gonna go ahead and

1929
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:09,036
do that green exclamation point if I can find it here.

1930
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:11,372
Where is that thing?

1931
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:16,843
It's probably pictograph, maybe, no.

1932
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:18,712
Anyone know where that would be?

1933
01:20:18,781 --> 01:20:20,814
Let's try, what's it called, checkmark or something.

1934
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:21,948
There it is.

1935
01:20:22,017 --> 01:20:25,152
There's our nice symbol right there.

1936
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:26,953
And let's go and add that to our UI as well.

1937
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:28,522
Let's go over here to our story board,

1938
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:30,824
we'll add it instead of Pi.

1939
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:33,661
So, we'll get rid of Pi instead we'll put that

1940
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:35,830
operation in there.

1941
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:38,866
What was it called again?

1942
01:20:38,935 --> 01:20:39,500
Check.

1943
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:46,406
Oops, two of them.

1944
01:20:46,475 --> 01:20:48,775
We've got this new green square root.

1945
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:51,144
We still have the old square root as well.

1946
01:20:51,213 --> 01:20:52,813
But we have to add this operation and

1947
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:57,550
I'm gonna use that trailing closure syntax right there.

1948
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:01,154
And of course we know this is, it's a double takes a double.

1949
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:05,025
And this would be where the stuff goes in there.

1950
01:21:05,094 --> 01:21:09,830
But we can let Swift infer this, and just use $0,

1951
01:21:09,899 --> 01:21:11,899
square root of $0.

1952
01:21:11,968 --> 01:21:15,035
So we've done everything except for the green.

1953
01:21:15,104 --> 01:21:18,004
Does everyone agree with this?

1954
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:21,174
I'm adding the unary Operation named this symbol and here is

1955
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:24,578
the second argument put on the trailing closure there.

1956
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:25,479
So how do we turn it green?

1957
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:28,315
Well, we just say display.textColor.

1958
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:34,121
Turns out UILabel has a text color = UIColor.green.

1959
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:36,222
Now, when we put this in here like this,

1960
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,790
it's gonna complain.

1961
01:21:37,859 --> 01:21:38,792
Why?

1962
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:41,428
Because, reference to property display and

1963
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:44,097
closure requires an explicit self dot

1964
01:21:44,166 --> 01:21:47,300
to make the capture semantics explicit.

1965
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:49,837
This is Swift saying watch out.

1966
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,040
If you do this, you're going to capture self right here.

1967
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:56,176
And that is going to create a memory cycle.

1968
01:21:59,281 --> 01:22:00,714
This closure right here,

1969
01:22:00,782 --> 01:22:03,550
which lives in the heap, is pointing to self.

1970
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:05,786
This addUnary operation is going to cause it,

1971
01:22:05,854 --> 01:22:08,422
this closure, to be put in the operations table which is

1972
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:09,689
pointed to by the View Controller.

1973
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,692
Now they point at each other.

1974
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,262
Let's see, what else did I forget here.

1975
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:16,230
Missing return.

1976
01:22:17,466 --> 01:22:19,065
Yes.

1977
01:22:19,134 --> 01:22:21,468
Return square root.

1978
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:25,772
Everybody cool with that?

1979
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:32,513
Now, to break that cycle, we could say, unowned self in.

1980
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:34,915
That's one way to break the cycle.

1981
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:40,888
We could say, weakSelf = self, if we do this

1982
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:45,491
one though we're gonna have to go here and say weakSelf?

1983
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,026
Either of those will break this cycle.

1984
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:50,597
In your homework, I've updated your homework to say you

1985
01:22:50,666 --> 01:22:54,167
cannot have any of these cycles in your homework.

1986
01:22:54,236 --> 01:22:56,303
Okay, in assignment three.

1987
01:22:56,372 --> 01:22:58,572
It's in the evaluation criteria down there.

1988
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:00,774
So I put, posted it on the forum for that too.

1989
01:23:00,843 --> 01:23:02,109
So let's go see if this works.

1990
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:08,248
By the way, what happens if we don't break that cycle,

1991
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:12,019
view controllers will just start accumulating in memory.

1992
01:23:12,088 --> 01:23:13,921
Because they'll be keeping,

1993
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,956
these closures will be keeping them on our memory.

1994
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:19,193
If you, for example, had a CalculatorViewController

1995
01:23:19,261 --> 01:23:22,028
that was being pushed on to you know segue two and

1996
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:25,465
then segue away from, it would not go into out of the heap,

1997
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,467
it would stay in heap in that case.

1998
01:23:27,536 --> 01:23:29,736
Right here is our calculator.

1999
01:23:29,805 --> 01:23:32,906
So 81 square root is 9 green square root?

2000
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:33,640
Woo hoo.

2001
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:34,842
Square root and turned to green.

2002
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:39,279
Okay, that's it, see you next time.

2003
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:43,784
